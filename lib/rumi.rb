"Today I am out wandering, turning my skull into a cup for others to drink wine from. In this town somewhere there sits a calm, intelligent man, who doesn't know what he's about to do!" ,
"With Your sweet Soul, this soul of mine has merged as water does with wine. Who can part the water from the wine, or me from You when we combine? You have become my greater self; how can smallness limit me? You have taken on my being, how shall I not take on Yours? Forever, You have claimed me that forever I may know You're mine." ,
"STAY CLOSE, MY HEART Stay close, my heart, to the one who knows your ways; Come into the shade of the tree that allays has fresh flowers. Don't stroll idly through the bazaar of the perfume-markers: Stay in the shop of the sugar-seller. If you don't find true balance, anyone can deceive you; Anyone can trick out of a thing of straw, And make you take it for gold Don't squat with a bowl before every boiling pot; In each pot on the fire you find very different things. Not all sugarcanes have sugar, not all abysses a peak; Not all eyes possess vision, not every sea is full of pearls. O nightingale, with your voice of dark honey! Go on lamenting! Only your drunken ecstasy can pierce the rock's hard heart! Surrender yourself, and if you cannot be welcomes by the Friend, Know that you are rebelling inwardly like a thread That doesn't want to go through the needle's eye! The awakened heart is a lamp; protect it by the him of your robe! Hurry and get out of this wind, for the weather is bad. And when you've left this storm, you will come to a fountain; You'll find a Friend there who will always nourish your soul. And with your soul always green, you'll grow into a tall tree Flowering always with sweet light-fruit, whose growth is interior." ,
"In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems. You dance inside my chest, where no one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that sight becomes this art. Drumsound rises on the air, its throb, my heart. A voice inside the beat says, \"I know you're tired, but come. This is the way.\" Are you jealous of the ocean's generosity? Why would you refuse to give this joy to anyone? Fish don't hold the sacred liquid in cups! They swim the huge fluid freedom." ,
"You are guardian of a treasure, Oh, just like a sleeping serpent And you shall see, I shall make you Spin around like that sleepy snake. Listen to me." ,
"YOU ARE SUCH THAT BESIDES THIS (PHYSICAL) BODY YOU HAVE ANOTHER (ASTRAL) BODY. DO NOT THEREFORE BE AFRAID OF GETTING OUT OF THE MORTAL FRAME." ,

"I said \"show me the ladder, that I may climb up to heaven ' He said \"your head is the ladder, bring your head down under your feet" ,
"Study me as much as you like, you will never know me, for I differ a hundred ways from what you see me to be. Put yourself behind my eyes, and see me as I see myself, for I have chosen to dwell in a place you cannot see." ,
"Although you see the pit, you cannot avoid it." ,
"This world's existence is one night long. There's a great lively gathering that night, but some people sleep through it." ,
"There are thousands of wines that can take over our minds. Don't think all ecstasies are the same! Jesus was lost in his love for God. His donkey was drunk with barley." ,
"You are a volume in the divine book A mirror to the power that created the universe Whatever you want, ask it of yourself Whatever you're looking for can only be found Inside of you" ,
"Dear soul, don't set a high value on someone before they deserve it; You either lose them or ruin yourself...!" ,
"I died as a mineral and became a plant, I died as a plant and rose to animal, I died as an animal and I was Man. Why should I fear? When was I less by dying?" ,

"Without the frown of clouds and lightning, the vines would be burned by the smiling sun." ,
"FORM IS ECSTATIC There is a shimmering excitement in being sentient and shaped. The caravan master sees his camels lost in it, nose to tail, as he himself is, his friend, and the stranger coming toward them. A gardener watches the sky break into song, cloud wobbly with what it is. Bud, thorn, the same. Wind, water, wandering this essential state. Fire, ground, gone. That's how it is with the outside. Form is ecstatic. Now imagine the inner: soul, intelligence, the secret worlds! And don't think the garden loses its ecstasy in winter. It's quiet, but the roots are down there rioutous. If someone bumps you in the street, don't be angry. Everyone careens about in this surprise. Respond in kind. Let the knots untie, turbans be given away. Someone drunk on this could drink a donkeyload a night. Believer, unbeliever, cynic, lover, all combine in the spirit-form we are, but no one yet is awake like Shams." ,
"The Oldest Thirst There Is Give us gladness that connects with the Friend, a taste of the quick, you that makes a cypress strong and jasmine jasmine. Give us the inner listening that is a way in itself and the oldest thirst there is. Don't measure it out with a cup. I am a fish. You are the moon. You cannot touch me, but your light can fill the ocean where I live." ,
"Only Love can explain itself." ,
"Be empty of worrying. Think of who created thought! Why do you stay in prison when the door is so wide open? Move outside the tangle of fear-thinking. Live in silence. Flow down and down in always widening rings of being." ,
"I see so deeply within myself -- Not needing my eyes. I can see everything clearly! Why would I want to bother my eyes again??? Now that I see the world ... through His eyes." ,
"Your heart is the size of an ocean. Go find yourself in its hidden depths." ,
"I am an atom; you are like the countenance of the Sun for me. I am a patient of Love you are like medicine for me. Without wings, without feathers, I fly about looking for you. I have become a Rose petal and you are like the Wind for me. Take me for a ride." ,
"Suddenly the drunken sweetheart appeared out of my door. She drank a cup of ruby wine and sat by my side. Seeing and holding the lockets of her hair My face became all eyes, and my eyes all hands." ,
"This is how the world speaks to us. It delights in spring blossoms, even as they fall." ,
"You are the universe in ecstatic motion." ,
"Look at the moon in the sky, not the one in the lake." ,
"When ink joins with a pen, then the blank paper can say something. Rushes and reeds must be woven to be useful as a mat. If they weren't interlaced, the wind would blow them away." ,
"The wailing of broken hearts is the doorway to God." ,
"Let the beauty we love be what we do." ,
"Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames." ,
"HE SAID: \"Who's knocking at my door?\" Said I: \"Your humble servant!\" Said He: \"What business have you got?\" Said I: \"I came to greet You!\" Said He: \"How long are you to push?\" Said I: \"Until You'll call me!\" Said He: \"How long are you to boil?\" Said I: \"Till resurrection!\" I claimed I was a lover true and I took may oaths That for the sake of love I lost my kingdom and my wealth! He said: \"You make a claim - the judge needs witness for your cause!\" Said I: \"My witness is my tears, my proof my yellow face!\" Said He: \"The witness is corrupt, your eye is wet and ill!\" Said I: \"No, by Your eminence: My eye is sinless clear!\" He said: \"And what do you intend?\" Said I: \"Just faithful friendships!\" Said He: \"What do you want from me?\" Said I: \"Your grace abundant!\" Said He: \"Who travelled here with you?\" Said I: \"Your dream and phantom!\" Said He: \"And what led you to me?\" Said I: \"Your goblet's fragrance!\" Said He: \"What is most pleasant, say?\" Said I: \"The ruler's presence!\" Said He: \"What did you see there, friend?\" Said I: \"A hundred wonders!\" Said He: \"Why is it empty now?\" Said I: \"From fear of brigands!\" Said He: \"The brigand, who is that?\" Said I: \"IT is the blaming!\" Said He: \"And where is safety then?\" Said: \"In renunciation.\" Said He: \"Renunciation? That's ... ?\" Said I: \"The path to safety!\" Said He: \"And where is danger, then?\" Said I: \"In Your love's quarters!\" Said He: \"And how do you fare there?\" Said I: \"Steadfast and happy.\" I tested you and tested you, but it availed to nothing - Who tests the one who was once tried, he will repent forever! Be silent! If I'd utter here the secrets fine he told me, You would go out all of yourself, no door nor roof could hold you" ,

"You attain to knowledge by argument; You attain a craft or skill by practice; If voluntary poverty's your choice, companionship's the way, not hand or tongue. The knowledge of it passes soul to soul, not by way of talk or reams of notes. Its signs are writ upon the seeker's heart, yet still the seeker cannot ken those signs until his heart becomes exposed to light Then God reveals His: Did We not expose? [Qur'an 94:1] for We've exposed the chambers of your breast and placed the exposition in your heart" , 
"If the beloved is everywhere, the lover is a veil, but when living itself becomes the Friend, lovers disappear." , 
"Sometimes You are kind, sometimes unfaithful, You break my heart but My Love, my essence, do not go away I can't be without You. You are the head and I am the feet You are the hand, I am our banner If You leave, I will perish I can't be without You. You have erased my image, taken my sleep You've torn me away from everybody but I can't be without You. I find no joy in life or relief in death. Why don't You say it too. I can't be without You." ,

"But let's suppose for a moment that my inspiration is not divine. Still, you would agree, my speaking is not inferior to the workings of a bee? The Quran says, God has inspired the bee. This universe is filled with honey. Human beings feed on it and evolve upward with the same, but more profound, inspiration as the bee." ,
"From the beginning of my life I have been looking for your face but today I have seen it Today I have seen the charm, the beauty, the unfathomable grace of the face that I was looking for" ,

"You've seen my descent, now watch my rising." ,
"If you desire healing, let yourself fall ill let yourself fall ill." ,
"Lay aside caution, it cannot help thee against destiny; to worry with precaution is to toil and moil; go, trust in providence, trust in the better part." ,
"Purify your eyes, and see the pure world. Your life will fill with radiant forms." ,
"The breezes at dawn have secrets to tell you Don't go back to sleep! You must ask for what you really want. Don't go back to sleep! People are going back and forth across the doorsill where the two worlds touch, The door is round and open Don't go back to sleep!" ,
"Out beyond the ideas of wrongdoing and right doing, there is a field. I'll meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about. Ideas, language, even the phrase 'each other' doesn't make any sense." ,
"AN EMPTY GARLIC \"You miss the garden, because you want a small fig from a random tree. You don't meet the beautiful woman. You're joking with an old crone. It makes me want to cry how she detains you, stinking mouthed, with a hundred talons, putting her head over the roof edge to call down, tasteless fig, fold over fold, empty as dry-rotten garlic. She has you tight by the belt, even though there's no flower and no milk inside her body. Death will open your eyes to what her face is: leather spine of a black lizard. No more advice. Let yourself be silently drawn by the stronger pull of what you really love." ,
"Yesterday I was clever so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise so I am changing myself." ,

"Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I'll meet you there." ,
"every experience will fill with immediacy. Because I love this, I am never bored. Beauty constantly wells up like the noise of springwater in my ear. Tree limbs rise and fall like ecstatic arms. Leaf sounds talk together like poets making fresh metaphors. The green felt cover slips; we get a flash of the mirror underneath. The conventional opinion of this poetry is that it shows great optimism for the future. But Father Reason says, No need to announce the future. This now is it. Your deepest need and desire is satisfied by this moment's energy here in your hand." ,
"A little mixed-breed apple, half red, half yellow, tells this story. A lover and beloved get separated. Their being apart was one thing, but they have opposite responses. The lover feels pain and grows pale. The beloved flushes and feels proud. I am a thorn next to my master's rose. We seem to be two, but we are not." ,
"Every object, every being, is a jar full of delight." ,
"Magicians can be confusing, but when Moses arrives and throws down the rod that becomes a dragon, how do the trick bowls look then? When something that alive comes, illusory matters fade. They quit bragging! A body's death, even, is beautiful to those who see with the soul's eye." ,
"I can conquer the World with a blink. I can heal a broken Heart with a Smile." ,
"Explanation by the tongue makes most things clear, But love unexplained is clearer" ,
"I said, \"I just want to know you and then disappear.\" She said, \"Knowing me does not mean dying." ,
"THE DEATH OF SALADIN You left ground and sky weeping, mind and soul full of grief. No one can take your place in existence or in absence. Both mourn, the angels, the prophets, and this sadness I feel has taken from me the taste of language, so that I can't say the flavor of my being apart. The roof of the kingdom within has collapsed! When I say the word YOU, I mean a hundred universes. Pouring grief water, or secret dripping in the heart, eyes in the head or eyes of the soul, I saw yesterday that all these flow out to find you when you're not here. That bright fire bird Saladin went like an arrow, and now the bow trembles and sobs. If you know how to weep for human beings, weep for Saladin." ,
"Friend, we're traveling together. Throw off your tiredness. Let me show you one tiny spot of the beauty that cannot be spoken. I'm like an ant that's gotten into the granary, ludicrously happy, and trying to lug out a grain that's way too big." ,
"Beauty surrounds us, but usually we need to be walking in a garden to know it." ,
"The way of love is not / a subtle argument. / The door there is devastation. / Birds make great sky-circles / of their freedom. / How do they learn it? / They fall, and falling, / they're given wings." ,
"THE INTEREST WITHOUT THE CAPITAL The lover's food is the love of the bread; no bread need be at hand: no one who is sincere in his love is a slave to existence. Lovers have nothing to do with existence; lovers have the interest without the capital. Without wings they fly around the world; without hands they carry the polo ball off the field. That dervish who caught the scent of Reality used to weave basket even though his hand had been cut off. Lover have pitched their tents in nonexistence: they are of one quality and one essence, as nonexistence is." , 
"Every object, every being, is a jar full of delight. Be a connoisseur, and taste with caution. Any wine will get you high. Judge like a king, and choose the purest, the ones unadulterated with fear, or some urgency about \"what's needed.\" Drink the wine that moves you as a camel moves when it's been untied, and is just ambling about." ,
"Patience is not sitting and waiting, it is foreseeing. It is looking at the thorn and seeing the rose, looking at the night and seeing the day. Lovers are patient and know that the moon needs time to become full." ,
"The result of my life is no more than three words: I was raw, I became cooked, I was burnt." ,
"The way the night knows itself with the moon, be that way with me. Or, alternately translated, Union is a raging river running toward the sea. Tonight the moon kisses the stars. O beloved, be like that to me." ,
"We are the the night ocean filled with glints of light. We are the space between the fish and the moon, while we sit here together." , 
"Love Is the Treasure The temple of love is not love itself; True love is the treasure, Not the walls about it. Do not admire the decoration, But involve yourself in the essence, The perfume that invades and touches you; The beginning and the end. Discovered, this replaces all else, The apparent and the unknowable. Time and space are slaves to this presence." ,
"I swear, since seeing Your face, the whole world is fraud and fantasy The garden is bewildered as to what is leaf or blossom. The distracted birds can't distinguish the birdseed from the snare. A house of love with no limits, a presence more beautiful than venus or the moon, a beauty whose image fills the mirror of the heart." ,
"On the path of Love we are neither masters nor the owners of our lives. We are only a brush in the hand of the Master Painter." ,
"God picks up the reed-flute world and blows. Each note is a need coming through one of us, a passion, a longing pain. Remember the lips where the wind-breath originated, and let your note be clear. Don't try to end it. Be your note." ,
"There is a community of the spirit. Join it, and feel the delight of walking in the noisy street and being the noise. Drink all your passion, and be a disgrace. Close both eyes to see with the other eye" ,
"There is some kiss we want with our whole lives, the touch of spirit on the body. Seawater begs the pearl to break its shell. and the lily, how passionately it needs some wild darling! At night, I open the window and ask the moon to come and press its face against mine. Breathe into me. Close the language door and open the lovers window. The moon won't use the door, only the window." ,
"It doesn't matter that you've broken your vow a thousand times. Still come, and yet again, come." ,
"When I am with you, we stay up all night. When you're not here, I can't go to sleep. Praise God for those two insomnias! And the difference between them." ,
"Let your soul turn into a mirror that passionately wants to reflect Joseph. Hand him your present. Now let silence speak. As that begins, we will start out." ,
"Your love has pierced me to the depths, its ecstasy entwines both bone and nerve" ,
"When you look for God, God is in the look of your eyes In the thought of looking, nearer to you than your self, or things that have happened to you There's no need to go outside. Be melting snow. Wash yourself of yourself. A white flower grows in the quietness. Let your tongue become that flower." ,
"Come to the orchard in Spring. There is light and wine, and sweethearts in the pomegranate flowers. If you do not come, these do not matter. If you do come, these do not matter." ,
"Dance, when you're broken open. Dance, if you've torn the bandage off. Dance in the middle of the fighting. Dance in your blood. Dance when you're perfectly free." ,
"Love is the bridge between you and everything." ,
"We are pain and what cures pain, both. We are the sweet cold water and the jar that pours. I want to hold you close like a lute, so that we can cry out with loving. Would you rather throw stones at a mirror? I am your mirror and here are the stones." ,
"That moon, which the sky ne'er saw even in dreams, has returned And brought a fire no water can quench. See the body' s house, and see my. soul, This made drunken and that desolate by the cup of his love. When the host of the tavern became my heart-mate, My blood turned to wine and my heart to kabab. When the eye is filled with thought of him, a voice arrives : W ell done, O flagon, and bravo, wine! Love's fingers tear up, root and stem, Every house where sunbeams fall from love. When my heart saw love's sea, of a sudden It left me and leaped in, crying, , Find me.' The face of Shamsi Din, Tabriz's glory, is the sun In whose track the cloud-like hearts are moving" ,
"When I am silent, I have thunder hidden inside." ,
"Each has to enter the nest made by the other imperfect bird." ,
"Every story is us" ,
"If there were no grace and no kindness, conversation would be useless, and nothing we do would matter. Listen to the new stories that begin every day. If light were not beginning again in the east, I would not now wake and walk out inside this dawn." ,
"There are no minarets built in praise of what doubters say, no passionate talk about their lives. The coin faces of officials keep changing, but not the flame-tongued book of the sun. Be plain as day and a friend to what lasts. Cynics say the same thing over and over, \"I only know what I see.\" Every external form is a text to study, embodying a truth, the way medicine contains healing. Does a painter paint for the sake of the picture and not for the eyes of those who will look at it?" ,
"I've come to take you with me even if I must drag you along But first I must steal your heart then settle you in my soul. I've come as a spring to lay beside your blossoms To feel the glory of happiness and spread your flowers around I've come to show you off as the adornment in my house and elevate you to the heavens as the prayers of those in love. I've come to take back the kiss you once stole Either return it with grace or i must take it by force You're my life You're my soul Please be my last prayer My heart must hold you forever From the lowly earth to the high human soul There are a lot more than a thousand stages Since I've taken you along from town to town no way will I abandon you halfway down this road Though you're in my hands Though i can throw you around like a child and a ball I'll always need to chase after you" ,
"The animal soul, the intelligent soul, and two kinds of knowing There's a part of us that's like an itch. Call it the animal soul, a foolishness that, when we're in it, makes hundreds of others around us itchy. And there is an intelligent soul with another desire, more like sweet basil or the feel of a breeze. Listen and be thankful even for scolding that comes from the intelligent soul. It flows out close to where you flowed out. But that itchiness wants to put food in our mouths that will make us sick, feverish with the aftertaste of kissing a donkey's rump. It's like blackening your robe against a kettle without being anywhere near a table of companionship. The truth of being human is an empty table made of soul intelligence. Gradually reduce what you give your animal soul, the bread that after all overflows from sunlight. The animal soul itself spilled out and sprouted from the other. Taste more often what nourishes your clear light, and you'll have less use for the smoky oven. You'll bury that baking equipment in the ground! There are two kinds of knowing: one acquired, as a child in school memorizes facts and concepts from books and from what the teacher says, collecting information from the traditional sciences as well as the new sciences. With such intelligence you rise in the world. You get ranked ahead or behind others with regard to your competence in retaining information. YOu stroll with this intelligence in and out of fields of knowledge, getting always more marks on your tablets. There is another kind of tablet, one already completed inside you. A spring overflowing its springbox. A freshness in the center of your chest. This intelligence does not turn yellow or stagnate. It's fluid, and it doesn't move from outside to inside through the conduits of plumbing-learning. This second knowing is a fountainhead from within you moving out. Drink from there!" ,
"I wait with silent passion for one gesture one glance from you" ,
"Sometimes you hear a voice through the door calling you... This turning toward what you deeply love saves you." ,
"I could not have known what love is if I had never felt this longing. Anything done to excess becomes boring, except this overflow that moves toward you." ,
"What else can I say? You will only hear what you are ready to hear. Don't nod your head, Don't try to fool me; the truth of what you see is written all over your face!" ,
"Come with me while the wine shop is still open. We are dizzy with meeting each other." ,
"Drum sound rises on the air, its throb, my heart. A voice inside the beat says, \"I know you're tired, but come. This is the way." ,
"Do not feel lonely, the entire universe is inside you." ,
"In the house of lovers, the music never stops, the walls are made of songs & the floor dances" ,
"Choose a master, for without him this journey is full of tribulations, fears, and dangers. With no escort, you would be lost on a road you would have already taken. Do not travel alone on the Path." ,
"A servant wants to be rewarded for what he does. A lover wants only to be in love's presence, that ocean whose depth will never be known." ,
"The true lover is never free from striving, they revolve restlessly and ceaselessly around the light of God. And God consumes them, making them nothing, destroying the veil of their reason." ,
"Although the road is never ending take a step and keep walking, do not look fearfully into the distance... On this path let the heart be your guide for the body is hesitant and full of fear." ,
"Everything that is made beautiful and fair and lovely is made for the eye of one who sees." ,
"Those who don't feel this Love pulling them like a river, those who don't drink dawn like a cup of spring water or take sunset like supper, those who don't want to change, let them sleep. This Love is beyond the study of theology, that old trickery and hypocrisy. If you want to improve your mind that way sleep on. I've given up on my brain. I've torn the cloth to shreds and thrown it away. If you're not completely naked wrap your beautiful robe of words around you, and sleep" ,
"Wedding Night The day I've died, my pall is moving on - But do not think my heart is still on earth! Don't weep and pity me: \"Oh woe, how awful!\" You fall in devil's snare - woe, that is awful! Don't cry \"Woe, parted!\" at my burial - For me this is the time of joyful meeting! Don't say \"Farewell!\" when I'm put in the grave - A curtin is it for eternal bliss. You saw \"descending\" - now look at the rising! Is setting dangerous for sun and moon? To you it looks like setting, but it's rising; The coffin seems a jail, yet it means freedom. Which seed fell in the earth that did not grow there? Why do you doubt the fate of human seed? What bucket came not filled from out the cistern? Why should the Yusaf \"Soul\" then fear this well? Close here your mouth and open it on that side. So that your hymns may sound in Where-no-place" ,
"Press thy suit, yet with moderation; A blade of grass cannot pierce a mountain. If the sum that illumines the world Were to dry nigher, the world would be consumed" ,
"Do you know what you are? You are a manuscript of a divine letter. You are a mirror reflecting a noble face. This universe is not outside of you. Look inside yourself, everything that you want, you are already that." ,
"It's rigged ; everything, in your favor. So there is nothing to worry about. Is there some position you want, some office, some acclaim, some award, some con, some lover, maybe two, maybe three, maybe four ; all at once, maybe a relationship with God? I know there is a gold mine in you, when you find it the wonderment of the earth's gifts you will lay aside as naturally as does a child a doll. But, dear, how sweet you look to me kissing the unreal: comfort, fulfill yourself, in any way possible ; do that until you ache, until you ache, then come to me again." ,
"Let your eyes get used to light. Don't miss your own splendor! Don't stay in the batlike mind that loves complexity and doubt, the unlit niches. Bats seek those to live in, because there a bat's accomplishments seem greater than they are. He can impress as he confuses you with cave ramifications. Little by little accustom yourself to your own light," ,
"You're a mountain searching for it's echo! Whenever you hurt, you say, Lord God! The answer lives in that which bends you low and makes you cry out. Pain and the threat of death, for instance, do this. They make you clear. When they're gone, you lose purpose. You wonder what to do, where to go. This is because you're uneven in your opening: sometimes closed and unreachable, sometimes, with your shirt torn with longing. Your discursive intellect dominates for a time; then the universal, beyond-time intelligence comes. Sell your questioning talents, my son; buy bewildering surrender. Live simply and helpfully in that. Don't worry about the University of Bukhara with its prestigious curriculum." ,
"When Divine Love had its effect, It made rest and comfort disagreeable. When he experienced the ecstasy of love, He removed the crown from his head. He exchanged the Royal Throne for a life of poverty. Well done, 0 True Lover, well done! Ask about the ecstasy of love from him, Whose heart has been injured by love." ,
"The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along." , 
"Raise your words, not your voice, it's rain that grows flowers, not thunder." ,
"Infinitesimal Dust What is the light in the center of the darkness inside your soul? A royal radiance or a fantasy like the way the full moon comes up sometimes in daylight? But this is the sun itself, Shams and a truth prior to the soul. Human beings cannot endure such clarity. We make statues, apply paint, and use words with hidden allusions. When the eye that has seen Shams turns to look somewhere else, what does it see? In the love-ocean clothes are an embarrassment. Don't look to be famous here, and don't expect payment. An east wind bringing infinitesimal dust from Tabriz is the most I expect." ,
"I'm in love! Your advice, what are they? Love has poisoned me! Your remedies, what are they? I hear them shout: \"fast, Bind him feet!\" But if my heart that has gone mad! Those strings on my feet What is the point?" ,
"Whatever purifies you is the right path, I will not try to define it." ,

"THE LAMPS ARE DIFFERENT BUT THE LIGHT IS THE SAME So many garish lamps in the dying brain's lamp-show, Forget about them. Concentrate on the essence, concentrate on the Light. In lucid bliss, calmly smoking off its own holy fire, The Light streams towards you from all things, All people, all possible permutations of good, evil, thought, passion. The lamps are different, but the Light is the same. One matter, one energy, one Light, one Light-mind, Endlessly emanating all things. One turning and burning diamond, One, one, one. Ground yourself, strip yourself down, To blind loving silence. Stay there, until you see You are gazing at the Light With its own ageless eyes" ,

"She loved him so much she concealed his name in many phrases, the inner meanings known only to her." ,
"How will you know the difficulties of being human, if you are always flying off to blue perfection? Where will you plant your grief seeds? Workers need ground to scrape and hoe, not the sky of unspecified desire." ,

"How long will you say, \"I will conquer the whole world How long will you say, \"I will conquer the whole world and fill it with myself\"? Even if snow covered the world completely, the sun could melt it with a glance. A single spark of God's mercy can turn poison into springwater. Where there is doubt, He establishes certainty.",

"Today, like every other day, we wake up empty and frightened. Don't open the door to the study and begin reading. Take down the dulcimer. Let the beauty we love be what we do. There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground." ,
"You've so distracted me, your absence fans my love. Don't ask how. Then you come near. \"Do not...\" I say, and \"Do not...,\" you answer. Don't ask why this delights me." ,
"A King Inside Who Listens There are many people with their eyes open whose hearts are shut. What do they see? Matter. But someone whose love is alert, even if the eyes go to sleep, he or she will be waking up thousands of others. If you are not one of those light-filled lovers, restrain your desire-body's intensity. Put limits on how much you eat and how long you lie down. But if you are awake here in the chest, sleep long and soundly. Your spirit will be out roaming and working, even on the seventh level. Muhammad says, I close my eyes and rest in sleep, but my love never needs rest. The guard at the gate drowses. The king stays awake. You have a king inside who listens for what delights the soul. That king's wakefulness cannot be described in a poem." ,
"There is a rational soul leading your donkey through the mountain wilderness. When the donkey pulls away and takes off on its own, that clear one chases, calling, \"This place is full of wolves who would love to gnaw your bones and suck the sweet marrow.\" This sovereign self in you is not a donkey, but more like a stallion, and Muhammad is the stable keeper speaking quietly, Ta'alaw, in Arabic, Come, come. I am your trainer." ,

"When soul rises Into lips You feel the kiss You have wanted" ,
"Smell the aroma of beautiful food, then go to the latrine and sniff. \"What happened to you?\" Your dung will answer, \"My beauty was a lure, a trick to get inside you.\" Every matter particle does the same enchantment. Try to see the beginning and end at once. Would you willingly wear manacles just because they're made of gold? Admire the genius of an artist, but also watch what happens to him or her in old age, how the expert craftsman's craft diminishes." ,
"Be melting snow. Wash yourself of yourself." ,

"THE ONE THING YOU MUST DO There is one thing in this world you must never forget to do. If you forget everything else and not this, there's nothing to worry about, but if you remember everything else and forget this, then you will have done nothing in your life. It's as if a king has sent you to some country to do a task, and you perform a hundred other services, but not the one he sent you to do. So human being come to this world to do particular work. That work is the purpose, and each is specific to the person. If you don't do it, it's as though a priceless Indian sword were used to slice rotten meat. It's a golden bowl being used to cook turnips, when one filing from the bowl could buy a hundred suitable pots. It's like a knife of the finest tempering nailed into a wall to hang things on. You say, \"But look, I'm using the dagger. It's not lying idle.\" Do you hear how ludicrous that sounds? For a penny an iron nail could be bought to serve for that. You say, \"But I spend my energies on lofty enterprises. I study jurisprudence and philosophy and logic and astronomy and medicine and the rest.\" But consider why you do those things. They are all branches of yourself. Remember the deep root of your being, the presence of your lord. Give yourself to the one who already owns your breath and your moments. If you don't, you will be like the man who takes a precious dagger and hammers it into his kitchen wall for a peg to hold his dipper gourd. You'll be wasting valuable keenness and forgetting your dignity and purpose." ,
"Someone said: \"I have neglected that true purpose.\" replied: When this thought enters a person's mind and they criticize them self, saying, \"What am I about, and why do I do these things?\" When this happens, it is a sure proof that God loves them and cares for them. \"Love continues so long as reprimands continue,\" said the poet. We may reprimand our friends, but we never reprimand a stranger. Now there are levels of reprimand. When a person is stung by it and sees the truth in it, that is a sign that God loves them and cares for them. But if the reprimand flies by that person without causing any pain at all, then this is no sign of love. When a carpet is beaten to get rid of the dust, intelligent people do not call that a reprimand. But if a woman beats her own darling child, then that is called a reprimand and is a proof of her love. Therefore, as long as you find pain and regret within yourself, that is a proof of God's love and guidance. If you find fault in your brother or sister, the fault you see in them is within yourself. The true Sufi is like a mirror where you see your own image, for \"The believer is a mirror of their fellow believers.\" Get rid of those faults in yourself, because what bothers you in them bothers you in yourself. An elephant was led to a well to drink. Seeing itself in the water, it shied away. It thought it was shying away from another elephant. It did not realize it was shying away from its own self. All evil qualities;oppression, hatred, envy, greed, mercilessness, pride;when they are within yourself, they bring no pain. When you see them in another, then you shy away and feel the pain. We feel no disgust at our own scab and abscess. We will dip our infected hand into our food and lick our fingers without turning in the least bit squeamish. But if we see a tiny abscess or half a scratch on another's hand, we shy away from that person's food and have no stomach for it whatsoever. Evil qualities are just like scabs and abscesses; when they are within us they cause no pain, but when we see them even to a small degree in another, then we feel pain and disgust. Just as you shy away from your brother or sister, so you should excuse them for shying away from you. The pain you feel comes from those faults, and they see the same faults. The seeker of truth is a mirror for their neighbors. But those who cannot feel the sting of truth are not mirrors to anyone but themselves." ,
"Leave that which is not, but appears to be. Seek that which is, but is not apparent." , 
"Love flows down. The ground submits to the sky and suffers what comes. Is the ground worse for giving in like that? Do not put blankets over the drum. Open completely. Let your spirit ear listen to the green dome's passionate murmur." ,
"I am yours. Don't give myself back to me." ,
"Today, like every other day, we wake up empty and frightened. Don't open the door of your study and begin reading. Take down a musical instrument. Let the beauty we love be what we do. There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground." ,
"And from beyond the intellect, beautiful Love comes dragging her skirts, a cup of wine in her hand." ,
"The feelings trembled and flapped in his chest like a bird newly put in a cage." ,
"Apa perlunya teriakan bagi yang mampu mendengar bisikan" ,
"There is a secret medicine given only to those who hurt so hard they can't hope. The hopers would feel slighted if they knew." ,
"If a prisoner hadn't lived outside, he would not detest the dungeon. Desiring knows there's satisfaction beyond this. Straying maps the path. A secret freedom opens through a crevice you can barely see. Your love of many things proves they're one. Every separate stiff trunk and stem in the garden connects with nimble root hairs underground. The awareness a wine drinker wants cannot be tasted in wine, but that failure brings his deep thirst closer. So the heart keeps ignoring the waterfall and the key, but there is one guiding through all the desiring restlessness." ,
"A special spark rises from the sorrow of a burning heart. Have you ever heard how the sigh of a broken heart touches the Beloved?" ,
"I could spend a lifetime delighting in the image of the Friend But once my heart beholds the Friend then the pain becomes more precious than a thousand delights." ,

"You left and I cried tears of blood. My sorrow grows. Its not just that You left. But when You left my eyes went with You. Now, how will I cry?" ,
"From \"Blasphemy and the Core\" Keep walking, though there's no place to get to. Don't try to see through the distances. That's not for human beings. Move within, but don't move the way fear makes you move." ,
"i was dead i came alive i was tears i became laughter all because of love when it arrived my temporal life from then on changed to eternal love said to me you are not crazy enough you don't fit this house i went and became crazy crazy enough to be in chains love said you are not intoxicated enough you don't fit the group i went and got drunk drunk enough to overflow with light-headedness love said you are still too clever filled with imagination and skepticism i went and became gullible and in fright pulled away from it all love said you are a candle attracting everyone gathering every one around you i am no more a candle spreading light i gather no more crowds and like smoke i am all scattered now love said you are a teacher you are a head and for everyone you are a leader i am no more not a teacher not a leader just a servant to your wishes love said you already have your own wings i will not give you more feathers and then my heart pulled itself apart and filled to the brim with a new light overflowed with fresh life now even the heavens are thankful that because of love i have become the giver of light" ,
"Some Hindus have an elephant to show. No one here has ever seen an elephant. They bring it at night to a dark room. One by one, we go in the dark and come out saying how we experience the animal. One of us happens to touch the trunk. A water-pipe kind of creature. Another, the ear. A strong, always moving back and forth, fan-animal. Another, the leg. I find it still, like a column on a temple. Another touches the curve back. A leathery throne. Another, the cleverest, feels the tusk. A rounded sword made of porcelain. He is proud of his description. Each of us touches one place and understands the whole in that way. The palm and the fingers feeling in the dark are how the senses explore the reality of the elephant. If each of us held a candle there, and if we went in together, we could see it." ,

"My home has no address, my tracks leave no trace. I am neither body nor soul ... What can I say? I belong to the Self of the Beloved" ,
"All day I think about it, then at night I say it. Where did I come from, and what am I supposed to be doing? I have no idea. My soul is from elsewhere, I'm sure of that, and I intend to end up there." ,
"A thousand half-loves must be forsaken to take one whole heart home" ,
"The words that make the rose bloom were also said to me. The words told to the cypress to make it grow strong and straight. The instructions whispered to the jasmine. And whatever was said to the sugarcane to make it sweet. And to the pomegranate flowers to make them blush. The same thing is being said to me." ,
"BOOK BEAUTY Here's the end of that story about the old woman who wanted to lure a man with strange cosmetics. She made a paste of pages from the Qur'an to fill the deep creases on her face and neck with. This is not about an old woman, dear reader. It's about you, or anyone who tries to use books to make themselves attractive. There she is, sticking scripture, thick with saliva, on her face. Of course, the bits keep falling off. \"The devil,\" she yells, and he appears! \"This is a trick I've never seen. You don\'t need me. You are yourself a troop of demons!\" So people steal inspired words to get compliments. Don't bother. Death comes and all talking, stolen or not, stops. Pity anyone unfamiliar with silence when that happens. Polish your heart with mediation and quietness. Let the inner life grow generous and handsome like Joseph. Zuleika did that and her \"old woman's spring cold snap\" turned to mid-July. Dry lips wet from within. Ink is not rouge. Let language lie bygone. Now is where love breathes." ,
"A heart filled with desire for sweetness and tender souls must not waste itself with unsavory matters." ,
"The whole world is a form for truth. When someone does not feel grateful for that, the forms appear to be as he feels, they mirror his anger, his greed, his fear. Make peace with the universe. Take joy in it. It will turn to gold... Every moment a new beauty" ,
"Life Is Sweet But Merging With You Is Far Sweeter" ,
"Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I will meet you there." ,

"Come, come, whoever you are, come. Infidel, idolator, Wanderer, fire-worshipper, it doesn't matter, come. Ours is not a convent of despair. Come, even if you have broken your vow a hundred times, Come, come again." ,
"Cautious people say, \"I'll do nothing until I can be sure.\" Merchants know better. If you do nothing, you lose. Don't be one of those merchants who won't risk the ocean! This is much more important than losing or making money. This is your connection to God! You must set fire to have light. Trust means you're ready to risk what you currently have. Think of your fear and hope about your livelihood. They make you go to work diligently every day. Now consider what the prophets have done. Abraham wore fire for an anklet. Moses spoke to the sea. David molded iron. Solomon rode the wind. Work in the invisible world at least as hard as you do in the visible. Be companions with the prophets even though no one here will know that you are, not even the helpers of the qutb, the abdals. You can't imagine what profit will come! When one of those generous ones invites you into his fire, go quickly! Don't say, \"But will it burn me? Will it hurt?" ,
"Love is the whole thing. We are only pieces." ,
"If you look too closely at the form, you'll miss the essence" ,
"Recognizing Muhammad Before Muhammad appeared in form, there were scriptural references. People imagined how he would be and called on his presence in battle and sickness. They had thoughts and language about Muhammad. What good was that? Not everyone recognizes Muhammad. Many have a conception of him they can stand to live with. They don't know that if the shadow of Muhammad's true form falls across a wall, the wall will bleed! And it will no longer have two sides! What a blessing to be one thing. When others saw Muhammad, their awe evaporated, as counterfeit coins turn black in the flame. There are false coins who claim they want to be tested, all bravado. And there are touchstones that do not reveal impostors. There are mirrors that hide your flaws. Avoid hypocritical praise, and keep away from flattering mirrors, if you possibly can." ,
"Your hand opens and closes, opens and closes. If it were always a fist or always stretched open, you would be paralyzed. Your deepest presence is in every small contracting and expanding, the two as beautifully balanced and coordinated as birds' wings." ,

"Notice how each particle moves. Notice how everyone has just arrived here from a journey. Notice how each wants a different food. Notice how the stars vanish as the sun comes up, and how all streams stream toward the ocean. Look at the chefs preparing special plates for everyone, according to what they need. Look at this cup that can hold the ocean. Look at those who see the face. Look through Shams' eyes into the Water that is entirely jewels." ,
"In his mind she lay at his lap with his fingers gliding thru her straight beautiful hair. He smiles and says\" your beauty lights up everything around you." ,

"Forget safety. Live where you fear to live. Destroy your reputation. Be notorious." ,
"Where the lips are silent the heart has a thousand tongues." ,
"QUALITIES There is a sun-star rising outside form. I am lost in that other. It's sweet not to look at two worlds, to melt in meaning as honey melts in milk. No one tires of following the soul. I don't recall now what happens on the manifest plane. I stroll with those I have always wanted to know, fresh and graceful as a water lily, or a rose. The body is a boat; I am waves swaying against it. Whenever it anchors somewhere, I smash it loose, or smash it to pieces. If I get lazy and cold, flames come from my ocean and surround me. I laugh inside them like gold purifying itself. A certain melody makes the snake put his head down on a line in the dirt....Here is my head, brother: What next! Weary of form, I come into qualities. Each says, \"I am a blue-green sea. Dive into me!\" I am Alexander at the outermost extension of empire, turning all my armies in toward the meaning of armies, Shams." ,
"The waterwheel accepts water and turns and gives it away, weeping." ,
"When God wishes to help, he lets us weep. Wherever water flows, life flourishes, wherever tears fall divine mercy is shown." ,
"Our death is our wedding with eternity What is the secret? \"God is One.\" The sunlight splits when entering the windows of the house. This multiplicity exists in the cluster of grapes; It is not in the juice made from the grapes. For he who is living in the Light of God, The death of the carnal soul is a blessing. Regarding him, say neither bad nor good, For he is gone beyond the good and the bad. Fix your eyes on God and do not talk about what is invisible, So that he may place another look in your eyes. It is in the vision of the physical eyes That no invisible or secret thing exists. But when the eye is turned toward the Light of God What thing could remain hidden under such a Light? Although all lights emanate from the Divine Light Don't call all these lights \"the Light of God\"; It is the eternal light which is the Light of God, The ephemeral light is an attribute of the body and the flesh. ...Oh God who gives the grace of vision! The bird of vision is flying towards You with the wings of desire." ,
"In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems. You dance inside my chest where no-one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that sight becomes this art." ,
"Anyone who knows me, should learn to know me again; For I am like the Moon, you will see me with new face everyday." ,
"I would love to kiss you. The price of kissing is your life." ,

"That which God said to the rose, and caused it to laugh in full-blown beauty, He said to my heart, and made it a hundred times more beautiful." ,

"You know the value of every article of merchandise, but if you don't know the value of your own soul, it's all foolishness." ,
"Get yourself out of the way, and let joy have more space." ,
"The lion is most handsome when looking for food." ,
"Half-Heartedness Gamble everything for love, if you are a true human being. If not, leave this gathering. Half-heartedness does not reach into majesty. You set out to find God, but then you keep stopping for long periods at mean-spirited roadhouses." , 
"I want to be where your bare foot walks, because maybe before you step, you'll look at the ground. I want that blessing" ,
"Sunlight fell upon the wall; the wall received a borrowed splendor. Why set your heart on a piece of earth, O simple one? Seek out the source which shines forever." ,
"Let yourself be silently drawn by the stronger pull of what you really love." ,
"The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along." ,
"Your Soul and Mine. Use to be mingled. Breathing as One. Journeying as One." ,
"Love is that that never sleeps, nor even rests, nor stays for long with those that do. Love is language that cannot be said, or heard." ,
"I have spent my life dreaming of your face. Now, I have found it." ,
"Muhammad once was talking to a crowd of chieftains, princes with great influence, when a poor blind man interrupted him. Muhammad frowned and said to the man, \"Let me attend to these visitors. This is a rare chance, whereas you are already my friend. We'll have ample time.\" Then somebody nearby said, \"That blind man may be worth a hundred kings. Remember the proverb, Human beings are mines.\" World-power means nothing. Only the unsayable, jeweled inner life matters. Muhammad replied, \"Do not think that I'm concerned with being acknowledged by these authorities. If a beetle moves toward rosewater, it proves that the solution is diluted. Beetles love dung, not rose essence. If a coin is eager to be tested by the touchstone, that coin itself may be a touchstone. A thief loves the night. I am day. I reveal essences. A calf thinks God is a cow. A donkey's theology changes when someone new pets it and gives it what it wants. I am not a cow, or thistles for camels to browse on. People who insult me are only polishing the mirror" ,
"Only union with you gives joy. The rest if tearing down one building to put up another." ,
"All day I think about it, then at night I say it. Where did I come from, and what am I supposed to be doing? I have no idea. My soul is from elsewhere, I'm sure of that,and I intend to end up there. Who looks out with my eyes? What is the soul? I cannot stop asking. If I could taste one sip of an answer, I could break out of this prison for drunks. I didn't come here of my own accord, and I can't leave that way. Whoever brought me here, will have to take me home." ,
"Both light and shadow are the dance of Love." ,

"MAULANA'S LAST LETTER TO SHAMS Sometimes I wonder, sweetest love, if you Were a mere dream in along winter night, A dream of spring-days, and of golden light Which sheds its rays upon a frozen heart; A dream of wine that fills the drunken eye. And so I wonder, sweetest love, if I Should drink this ruby wine, or rather weep; Each tear a bezel with your face engraved, A rosary to memorize your name... There are so many ways to call you back- Yes, even if you only were a dream." ,
"Remember me. I will be with you in the grave on the night you leave behind your shop and your family. When you hear my soft voice echoing in your tomb, you will realize that you were never hidden from my eyes. I am the pure awareness within your heart, with you during joy and celebration, suffering and despair. On that strange and fateful night you will hear a familar voice -- you'll be rescued from the fangs of snakes and the searing sting of scorpions. The euphoria of love will sweep over your grave; it will bring wine and friends, candles and food. When the light of realization dawns, shouting and upheaval will rise up from the graves! The dust of ages will be stirred by the cities of ecstasy, by the banging of drums, by the clamor of revolt! Dead bodies will tear off their shrouds and stuff their ears in fright-- What use are the senses and the ears before the blast of that Trumpet? Look and you will see my form whether you are looking at yourself or toward that noise and confusion. Don't be blurry-eyed, See me clearly- See my beauty without the old eyes of delusion. Beware! Beware! Don't mistake me for this human form. The soul is not obscured by forms. Even if it were wrapped in a hundred folds of felt the rays of the soul's light would still shine through. Beat the drum, Follow the minstrels of the city. It's a day of renewal when every young man walks boldly on the path of love. Had everyone sought God Instead of crumbs and copper coins T'hey would not be sitting on the edge of the moat in darkness and regret. What kind of gossip-house have you opened in our city? Close your lips and shine on the world like loving sunlight. Shine like the Sun of Tabriz rising in the East. Shine like the star of victory. Shine like the whole universe is yours!" ,
"This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life. Finally, to take a step without feet." ,
"Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond." ,
"There are thousands of wines that can take over our minds. Don't think all ecstasies are the same!" ,
"Many of the faults you see in others, dear reader, are your own nature reflected in them. As the Prophet said, \"The faithful are mirrors to one another." ,
"I lamented in every gathering; I associated with those in bad or happy circumstances. (But) everyone became my friend from his (own) opinion; he did not seek my secrets from within me. My secret is not far from my lament, but eyes and ears do not have the light (to sense it." ,
"You are sitting here with us, but you are also out walking in a field at dawn. You are yourself the animal we hunt when you come with us on the hunt. You are in your body like a plant is solid in the ground, yet you are wind. You are the diver's clothes lying empty on the beach. You are the fish. In the ocean are many bright strands and many dark strands like veins that are seen when a wing is lifted up. Your hidden self is blood in those, those veins that are lute strings that make ocean music, not the sad edge of surf, but the sound of no shore." ,
"You could string a hundred endless days together, My soul would find no comfort from this pain. You laugh at my tale? You may be educated But you haven't learned to love till you're insane" ,
"I Have Vanished In the early morning, A lover asked her beloved, \"Do you love me more than yourself?\" \"More than myself? For sure I have no self any more; I am you already. The 'I' has gone; the 'you' has come about. Even my identity is gone. The answer is taken for granted. 'You and I' has no meaning. The 'I' has vanished like a drop into an ocean of honey." ,
"Within tears, find hidden laughter Seek treasures amid ruins, sincere one. " ,
"The Glance of Love is Crystal Clear." ,
"Stay together, friends. Don't scatter and sleep. Our friendship is made of being awake." ,
"A certain dervish tells a dream in the night-talking. \"I saw the sheikhs who are connected to Khidr. I asked them where I might get some daily food without being bothered about earning it, so I could continue my devotions uninterrupted. 'Come to the mountains and eat wild fruit. Our benedictions have made its bitterness sweet. That way your days will be free. 'I did as they said, and from the fruit came a gift of speech that made my words exciting and spiritually transporting, valuable to many. \"This is dangerous,\' I thought. \'Lord of the world, give me another, more hidden gift.\' I escaped. The beautiful speech left, and a joy came that I have never known. I burst open like a pomegranate. \'If heaven is nothing but this feeling, I have no further wish." ,
"The ear participates, and helps arrange marriages; the eye has already made love with what it sees. The eye knows pleasure, delights in the body's shape: the ear hears words that talk about all this. When hearing takes place, character areas change; but when you see, inner areas change. If all you know about fire is what you have heard see if the fire will agree to cook you! Certain energies come only when you burn. If you long for belief, sit down in the fire! When the ear receives subtly; it turns into an eye. But if words do not reach the ear in the chest, nothing happens.",

"There's a path from me to you I'm constantly looking for, so I try to keep clear and still as water does with the moon." ,
"I want to see you. Know your voice. Recognize you when you first come 'round the corner. Sense your scent when I come into a room you've just left. Know the lift of your heel, the glide of your foot. Become familiar with the way you purse your lips then let them part, just the slightest bit, when I lean in to your space and kiss you. I want to know the joy of how you whisper \"more" ,

"What hurts you, blesses you. Darkness is your candle." ,
"Love rushed into my veins emtying me of myself. Now filled with the Beloved ..... my only possession is my name" ,
"One day you will take my heart completely and make it more fiery than a dragon. Your eyelashes will write on my heart the poem that could never come from the pen of a poet." ,
"What sort of person says that he or she wants to be polished and pure, then complains about being handled roughly?" ,
"You try to be faithful And sometimes you're cruel. You are mine. Then, you leave. Without you, I can't cope. And when you take the lead, I become your footstep. Your absence leaves a void. Without you, I can't cope. You have disturbed my sleep, You have wrecked my image. You have set me apart. Without you, I can't cope." ,
"If the Beautiful One is not inside you, then what is that Light hidden under your cloak?" ,

"There is little one can say about love. It has to be lived, and it's always in motion." ,
"Drink from the presence of saints, not from those other jars." ,
"I want that love that moved the mountains. I want that love that split the ocean. I want that love that made the winds tremble. I want that love that roared like thunder. I want that love that will raise the dead. I want that love that lifts us to ecstasy. I want that love that is the silence of eternity." ,

"All religions. All this singing. One sone. Peace be with you." ,
"Don't sit and wait. Get out there, feel life. Touch the sun, and immerse in the sea." ,
"There is no worse torture than knowing intellectually about love and the way. Those Egyptian women, when they saw Joseph, they were not judging his handsomeness. They were lost in it, cutting their hands as they cut their food." ,
"In fact, my soul and yours are the same, You appear in me, I in you, We hide in each other." ,
"I am the bird of the spiritual Garden, not of this world of dust; for a few days, they have a cage of my body made." ,
"Smiles come best from those who weep." ,
"When a blind man gets his sight back, he says \"I am a divine seer, an oracle.\" With the excitement of the change he's a little drunk. A drunk becoming sober is very different from the ecstatic change that comes in the living presence of an enlightened one. There's no way to say how that is, even if Abu ibn Sina were here. Only by the great Names, or by meditation inside music that plays without instruments, can coverings be lifted. Not by sermons or mental effort. One who tries to do that will cut off his hand with his famous sword. This is all metaphoric: there is no covering or hand. It's like the country saying, Yeah, if my aunt had testicles, she'd be my uncle. It's what-if talking: the distance from words to living is a journey of a hundred thousand years, but don't be discouraged! It can happen any moment. It takes thirty-five hundred years to get to Saturn, but Saturnine qualities are constantly here making us solemn and serious. Influence goes the other way too. An enlightened master, which is to say the inner nature of each of us, is continually affecting the universe. Philosophers say a human being is the universe in samll, but it is more true that the essence of a human is the whole from which the cosmos grew. It looks as if fruit grows from a branch, but growth comes more truly from the gardener's hope and the work of sowing the seed that grew inside the fruit. The tree of the universe grows out of the fruit and its seed, even though in form the tree bears the fruit." ,
"In The End In the end, the mountains of imagination were nothing but a house. And this grand life of mine was nothing but an excuse. You've been hearing my story so patiently for a lifetime Now hear this: it was nothing but a fairy tale." ,
"I didn't come here of my own accord, and I can't leave that way. Whoever brought me here will have to take me home." ,
"In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems. You dance inside my chest, where no one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that light becomes this art." ,
"To Love is to be God. Never will a Lover's chest feel any sorrow. Never will a Lover's robe be touched by mortals. Never will a Lover's body be found buried in the earth. To Love is to be God." ,
"Some nights stay up till dawn, as the moon sometimes does for the sun. Be a full bucket pulled up the dark way of a well, then lifted out into light." ,
"But listen to me. For one moment quit being sad. Hear blessings dropping their blossoms around you." ,
"We are all faced with incidents that teach us to be less selfish and judgmental and more compassionate and generous." ,
"Imagine a man selling his donkey to be with Jesus. Now imagine him selling Jesus to get a ride on a donkey. This does happen. Jesus can transform a drunk into gold. If the drunk is already golden, he can be changed to pure diamond. If already that, he can become the circling planets, Jupiter, Venus, the moon. Never think that you are worthless. God has paid an enormous amount for you, and the gifts keep arriving." ,
"Love rests on no foundation. It is an endless ocean, with no beginning or end." ,
"How Finite Minds Most Want To Be You are the living marrow. The rest is hay, and dead grass does not nourish a human being. When you are not here, this desire we feel has no traveling companion. When the sun is gone, the soul's clarity fades. There is nothing but idiocy and mistakes. We are half-dead, inanimate, exhausted. The way finite minds most want to be is an ocean with a soul swimming in it. No one can describe that. These words do not touch you. Metaphors mentioning the moon have no effect on the moon. My soul, you are a master, a Moses, a Jesus. Why do I stay blind in your presence? You are Joseph at the bottom of his well. Constantly working, but you do not get paid, because what you do seems trivial, like play. Now silence. Unless these words fill with nourishment from the unseen, they will stay empty, and why would I serve my friends bowls with no food in them?" ,
"Lovers find secret places inside this violent world where they make transactions with beauty." ,
"With passion pray. With passion make love. With passion eat and drink and dance and play. Why look like a dead fish in this ocean of God?" ,
"All Through Eternity All through eternity Beauty unveils His exquisite form in the solitude of nothingness; He holds a mirror to His Face and beholds His own beauty. he is the knower and the known, the seer and the seen; No eye but His own has ever looked upon this Universe. His every quality finds an expression: Eternity becomes the verdant field of Time and Space; Love, the life-giving garden of this world. Every branch and leaf and fruit Reveals an aspect of His perfection- They cypress give hint of His majesty, The rose gives tidings of His beauty. Whenever Beauty looks, Love is also there; Whenever beauty shows a rosy cheek Love lights Her fire from that flame. When beauty dwells in the dark folds of night Love comes and finds a heart entangled in tresses. Beauty and Love are as body and soul. Beauty is the mine, Love is the diamond. They have together since the beginning of time- Side by side, step by step" ,
"The moon splits open. We move through, waterbirds rising to look for another lake. Or say we are living in a love-ocean, where trust works to caulk our body-boat, to make it last a little while, until the inevitable shipwreck, the total marriage, the death-union. Dissolve in friendship, like two drunkards fighting. Do not look for justice here in the jungle where your animal soul gives you bad advice. Drink enough wine so that you stop talking. You are a lover, and love is a tavern where no one makes much sense. Even if the things you say are poems as dense as sacks of Solomon's gold, they become pointless." ,
"WONDER WITHOUT WILLPOWER Love's way becomes a pen sometimes writing g-sounds like gold or r-sounds like tomorrow in different calligraphy styles sliding by, darkening the paper Now it's held upside down, now beside the head, now down and on to something else, figuring. One sentence saves an illustrious man from disaster, but fame does not matter to the split tongue of a pen. Hippocrates knows how the cure must go. His pen does not. This one I am calling pen, or sometimes flag, has no mind. You, the pen, are most sanely insane. You cannot be spoken of rationally. Opposites are drawn into your presence but not to be resolved. You are not whole or ever complete. You are the wonder without willpower going where you want." ,
"A mountain keeps an echo deep inside itself. That's how I hold your voice. I am scrap wood thrown in your fire, and quickly reduced to smoke." ,
" Moon and evening star do their slow tambourine dance to praise this universe. The purpose of every gathering is discovered: to recognize beauty and love what's beautiful. \"Once it was like that, now it's like this,\" the saying goes around town, and serious consequences too. Men and women turn their faces to the wall in grief. They lose appetite. Then they start eating the fire of pleasure, as camels chew pungent grass for the sake of their souls. Winter blocks the road. Flowers are taken prisoner underground. Then green justice tenders a spear. Go outside to the orchard. These visitors came a long way, past all the houses of the zodiac, learning Something new at each stop. And they're here for such a short time, sitting at these tables set on the prow of the wind. Bowls of food are brought out as answers, but still no one knows the answer. Food for the soul stays secret. Body food gets put out in the open like us. Those who work at a bakery don't know the taste of bread like the hungry beggars do. Because the beloved wants to know, unseen things become manifest. Hiding is the hidden purpose of creation: bury your seed and wait. After you die, All the thoughts you had will throng around like children. The heart is the secret inside the secret. Call the secret language, and never be sure what you conceal. It's unsure people who get the blessing. Climbing cypress, opening rose, Nightingale song, fruit, these are inside the chill November wind. They are its secret. We climb and fall so often. Plants have an inner Being, and separate ways of talking and feeling. An ear of corn bends in thought. Tulip, so embarrassed. Pink rose deciding to open a competing store. A bunch of grapes sits with its feet stuck out. Narcissus gossiping about iris. Willow, what do you learn from running water? Humility. Red apple, what has the Friend taught you? To be sour. Peach tree, why so low? To let you reach. Look at the poplar, tall but without fruit or flower. Yes, if I had those, I'd be self-absorbed like you. I gave up self to watch the enlightened ones. Pomegranate questions quince, Why so pale? For the pearl you hid inside me. How did you discover my secret? Your laugh. The core of the seen and unseen universes smiles, but remember, smiles come best from those who weep. Lightning, then the rain-laughter. Dark earth receives that clear and grows a trunk. Melon and cucumber come dragging along on pilgrimage. You have to be to be blessed! Pumpkin begins climbing a rope! Where did he learn that? Grass, thorns, a hundred thousand ants and snakes, everything is looking for food. Don't you hear the noise? Every herb cures some illness. Camels delight to eat thorns. We prefer the inside of a walnut, not the shell. The inside of an egg, the outside of a date. What about your inside and outside? The same way a branch draws water up many feet, God is pulling your soul along. Wind carries pollen from blossom to ground. ",
"Wings and Arabian stallions gallop toward the warmth of spring. They visit; they sing and tell what they think they know: so-and-so will travel to such-and-such. The hoopoe carries a letter to Solomon. The wise stork says lek-lek. Please translate. It's time to go to the high plain, to leave the winter house. Be your own watchman as birds are. Let the remembering beads encircle you. I make promises to myself and break them. Words are coins: the vein of ore and the mine shaft, what they speak of. Now consider the sun. It's neither oriental nor occidental. Only the soul knows what love is. This moment in time and space is an eggshell with an embryo crumpled inside, soaked in belief-yolk, under the wing of grace, until it breaks free of mind to become the song of an actual bird, and God." ,
"Be silent now. Say fewer and fewer praise poems. Let yourself become living poetry." ,
"Close the language door and open the lovers window. The moon won't use the door, only the window." ,
"Moses questions God about death Moses asks God the most basic question, \"You create us; then you kill us. \"Why\" God says, I understand the purpose within your question; therefore I'll answer. You want to know the meaning of phenomenal duration, so you can teach others and help their souls unfold. Anyone who asks this question has some of the answer. Sow seed corn, Moses, and you will experience the purpose of taking a form. Moses plants and tends the crop; when the ears have ripened to the shape of their beauty, he brings out to the field his blade and sharpening stone. The unseen voice comes, Why did you work to bring the corn to perfection only now to chop it down? \"Lord, it is the winnowing time when we separate the corn grains we use for food from the straw we use for bedding and fodder. They must be stored in different cribs in the barn.\" Where did you learn this threshing-floor work? \"You gave me discernment.\" Do you not feel that I should have a similar discernment in the planting and harvesting of forms that I do? So creation has a purpose. God has said, I was a hidden treasure, and I desired to be known. That desire is part of manifestation." ,
"A craftsman pulled a reed from the reedbed, cut holes in it, and called it a human being. Since then, it's been wailing a tender agony of parting, never mentioning the skill that gave it life as a flute" ,

"I, you, he, she, we In the garden of mystic lovers, these are not true distinctions." ,
"THIS TORTURE Why should we tell you our love stories when you spill them together like blood in the dirt? Love is a pearl lost on the ocean floor, or a fire we can't see, but how does saying that push us through the top of the head into the light above the head? Love is not an iron pot, so this boiling energy won't help. Soul, heart, self. Beyond and within those is one saying, How long before I'm free of this torture!" ,
"What I most want is to spring out of this personality, then to sit apart from that leaping. I've lived too long where I can be reached." ,
"The same wind that uproots trees makes the grass shine. The lordly wind loves the weakness and the lowness of grasses. Never brag of being strong. The axe doesn't worry how thick the branches are. It cuts them to pieces. But not the leaves. It leaves the leaves alone." ,
"Are you jealous of the ocean's generosity? Why would you refuse to give this love to anyone? Fish don't hold the sacred liquid in cups! They swim in the huge, fluid freedom." ,

"A lover asked his beloved, Do you love yourself more than you love me? Beloved replied, I have died to myself and I live for you. I've disappeared from myself and my attributes, I am present only for you. I've forgotten all my learnings, but from knowing you I've become a scholar. I've lost all my strength, but from your power I am able. I love myself...I love you. I love you...I love myself." ,
"Be crumbled. So wild flowers will come up where you are. You have been stony for too many years. Try something different. Surrender." ,
"From \"Wetness and Water\" How does a part of the world leave the world? How can wetness leave water? Do not try to put out a fire by throwing on more fire. Do not wash a wound with blood. No matter how fast you run, your shadow more than keeps up. Sometimes it's in front. Only full, overhead sun diminishes your shadow. But that shadow has been serving you. What hurts you blesses you. Darkness is your candle. Your boundaries are your quest." ,
"I choose to love you in silence, for in silence I find no rejection. I choose to love you in loneliness, for in loneliness no one owns you but me. I choose to adore you from a distance, for distance will shield me from pain. I chose to kiss you in the wind, for the wind is gentler than my lips. I choose to hold you in my dreams, for in my dreams you have no end." ,
"The way of love is not a subtle argument. The door there is devastation. Birds make great sky-circles of their freedom. How do they learn it? They fall, and falling, they're given wings." ,

"I came with many knots in my heart, like the magician's rope. You undid them all at once. I see now the splendor of the student and that of the teacher's art. Love and this body sit inside your presence, one demolished, the other drunk. We smile. We weep, tree limbs turning sere, then light green." ,
"Let the beauty we love be what we do. There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground." ,
"I was dead I came alive I was tears I became laughter All because of love when it arrived my temporal life from then on changed to eternal Love said to me you are not crazy enough you don't fit this house I went and became crazy crazy enough to be in chains Love said you are not intoxicated enough you don't fit the group I went and got drunk drunk enough to overflow with light-headedness Love said you are still too clever filled with imagination and skepticism I went and became gullible and in fright pulled away from it all Love said you are a candle attracting everyone gathering every one around you I am no more a candle spreading light I gather no more crowds and like smoke I am all scattered now Love said you are a teacher you are a head and for everyone you are a leader I am no more not a teacher not a leader just a servant to your wishes Love said you already have your own wings I will not give you more feathers And then my heart pulled itself apart and filled to the brim with a new light overflowed with fresh life Now even the heavens are thankful that because of love I have become the giver of light" ,
"If A Tree Could Wander Oh, if a tree could wander and move with foot and wings! It would not suffer the axe blows and not the pain of saws! For would the sun not wander away in every night ? How could at ev'ry morning the world be lighted up? And if the ocean's water would not rise to the sky, How would the plants be quickened by streams and gentle rain? The drop that left its homeland, the sea, and then returned ? It found an oyster waiting and grew into a pearl. Did Yusaf not leave his father, in grief and tears and despair? Did he not, by such a journey, gain kingdom and fortune wide? Did not the Prophet travel to far Medina, friend? And there he found a new kingdom and ruled a hundred lands. You lack a foot to travel? Then journey into yourself! And like a mine of rubies receive the sunbeams? print! Out of yourself ? such a journey will lead you to your self, It leads to transformation of dust into pure gold!" ,
"Love is an open secret, the most obvious thing in the world and the most hidden, with no why to how it keeps its mystery." ,

"May these nuptials be blessed for us, may this marriage be blessed for us, May it be ever like milk and sugar, this marriage like wine and halvah. May this marriage be blessed with leaves and fruits like the date tree; May this marriage be laughing forever, today,tomorrow, like the houris of paradise. May this marriage be the sign of compassion and the approval of happiness here and hereafter; May this marriage be fair of fame, fair of face and fair of omen as the moon in the azure sky. I have fallen silent for words cannot describe how the spirit has mingled with this marriage" ,

"Better to be a prey than a hunter. Make yourself My fool. Stop trying to be the sun and become a speck! Dwell at My door and be homeless. Don't pretend to be a candle, be a moth, so you may taste the savor of Life and know the power hidden in serving." ,
"If we come to sleep we are His drowsy ones And if we come to wake we are in His hands If we come to weeping we are His cloud full of raindrops And if we come to laughing we are His lightning in that moment If we come to anger and battle it is the reflection of His wrath And if we come to peace and pardon it is the reflection of His love Who are we in this complicated world?" ,
"There's hidden sweeteness in the stomach's emptiness. We are lutes, no more no less. If the soundbox is stuffed full of anything, no music. If the brain and the belly are burning clean with fasting, every moment a new song comes out of the fire. The fog clears, and new energy makes you run up the steps in front of you. Be emptier and cry like reed instruments cry. Emptier, write secrets with the reed pen. When you're full of food and drink, an ugly metal statue sits where your spirit should. When you fast, good habits gather like friends who want to help. Fasting is Solomon's ring. Don't give it to some illusion and lose your power, but even if you have, if you've lost all will and control, they come back when you fast, like soldiers appearing out of the ground, pennants flying above them. A table descends to your tents, Jesus' table. Expect to see it, when you fast, this table spread with other food, better than the broth of cabbages." ,
"However much I might try to expound or explain Love, when I come to Love itself, I am ashamed of my explanations... Love alone can explain the mysteries of love and lovers." ,
"Fool came and sat in a seat above one of the great saints. What difference does it make to the saints whether such a person is above or below the lamp? If the lamp wants to be on high, it does not desire that for its own sake. Its purpose is for the benefit of others, so they can enjoy their share of the light. Wherever the lamp may be, whether below or above, it is still the lamp of the Eternal Sun. Read -( The seeker of truth is a mirror for others) If the saint seeks worldly rank and office,it is for this purpose: They desire to snare those world lings, who do not have the vision to see their true elevation, with a trap of worldly rank. Through this they may find their way to the higher worlds, and fall into the trap of divine grace. In this same way, the Prophet, Mohammed did not conquer Mecca and the surrounding lands because he was in need of them. He conquered in order to give life and grant light to all people. \"This is a hand accustomed to give, it is not accustomed to take.\" The saints beguile people in order to bestow gifts on them, not to take anything away. Read -( God Remain in yourself if?) When someone lays a trap and catches little birds to eat and sell, that is called cunning. But if a king lays a trap to capture an untutored and worthless hawk, having no knowledge of its own true nature, to train it to his own forearm so that it may become ennobled, that is not called cunning. Though to outward appearance it is cunning, yet it is known to be the very acme of caring and generosity, restoring the dead to life, converting the base stone into a ruby, and far more than that. If the hawk knew for what reason the king wanted to capture it, it would not require any bait. It would search for the trap with soul and heart, and would fly to the king's hand. People only listen to the outward significance of the saints' words. They say, \"We've heard plenty of this. Read ( The true believer is a mirror?) Our hearts are stuffed full of words of this kind.\" God says, \"God forbid that you should be full of them! You are full of your own whispering s and vain conceits. You are full of illusion and greed. Nay, you are full of cursing.\" If only they were empty of such ravings! Then they would be open to receive these words. But they are not open to receive them. God has set a seal upon their ears and eyes and hearts. Their eyes see things the opposite of what they are; they hear wisdom as gibberish and raving. Their heartshave been transformed into a home of self-loveand vanity. A winter's tangle of dark shapes and pride has possessed them. Their hearts are hardened with ice and frost. Read -( forty rules of love ) \"God has set a seal on their hearts And their hearing, And on their eyes is a covering.\" How likely is it that such people could be full of these true words? They have never caught so much as a whiff of them. They have never tasted a drop in all their lives;neither they nor those they worship, nor their miserable household.",

"The Drunken Gnat You are the soul of the soul, a door that opens into existence. When separation makes us angry, you strike with a sword. When union becomes vague, you feed it with a vast nothing. Old civilizations start to flourish again. The March sun warms the world with singing. Tambourine and harp, branches covered with buds. Is anyone sober enough to speak with the king? No one. All right. Remember how a gnat once got drunk and walked into the ear of a terrible tyrant, then from there into his brain and killed him? Grape-wine can do that to a gnat. What will the wine of infinity do for us? A cave dog watched over the sleepers. If a dog can be a shepherd, what could the spirit-lion of a human being become? Sparks from a fire lift in the sky and turn to stars. Shams is now a depth of truth that rises every morning in the east." ,
"Never lose hope when the Beloved sends you away. If you're abandoned if you're left hopeless tomorrow for sure you'll be called again.

"Who could be so lucky? Who comes to a lake for water and sees the reflection of moon?" ,
"Tonight is a night of union for the stars and of scattering, scattering, since a bride is coming from the skies, consisting of a full moon. Venus cannot contain hereself for charming melodies, like the nightingale which becomes intoxicated with the rose in spring-time. See how the polestar is ogling Leo; behold what dust Pisces is stirring up drom the deep! Jupiter has galloped his steed against ancient Saturn, saying \"Take back your youth and go, bring good tidings!\" Mars' hand, which was full of blood from the handle of his sword, has become as life-giving as the sun, the exalted in works. Since Aquarius has come full of that water of life, the dry cluster of Virgo is raining pearls from him. The Pleiades full of goodness fears not Libra and being broken; how should Aries flee away in fright from its mother? When from the moon the arrow of a glance struck the heart of Sagittarius, he took to night-faring in passion for her, like Scorpio. On such a festival, go, sacrifice Taurus, else you are crooked of gait in the mud like Cancer. This sky is the astrolabe, and the reality is Love; whatever wesay of this, attend to the meaning. Shamsi-Tabriz, on that dawn when you shine, the dark night is transformed to bright day by your moonlike face." ,

"Everyone is so afraid of death, but the real sufis just laugh: nothing tyrannizes their hearts. What strikes the oyster shell does not damage the pearl" ,
"THE CREEK AND THE STARS Spirit is so mixed with the visible world that giver, gift, and beneficiary are one thing. You are the grace raining down; the grace is you. Creation is a clear, flat, fast-moving creek, where qualities reflect. Generations rush by, while the stars stay still without a splash. When you lose your appetite for food, you'll be given other nourishment. There's well-being that is not bodily and beings that live on fragrance. Don't worry about losing animal energy. Go the way of love and ask provisions. Love more the star region reflected, less the moving medium." ,
"Thankfulness brings you to the place where the Beloved lives." ,
"Oh sky, without me, do not change, Oh moon, without me, do not shine; Oh earth, without me, do not grow, Oh time, without me, do not go. Others give you the name of Love, And me the sultan of that love. Higher than such illusions, Oh, you cannot go, without me." ,
"Ripened Fruit Do you remember how you came into existence? You may not remember because you arrived a little drunk. Let me give you a hint: Let go off your mind and then be mindful. Close your ears and listen! It is difficult to speak to your unripeness. You may still be in your springtime, unaware that autumn exists. This world is a tree to which we cling---- we, the half-ripe fruit upon it. The immature fruit clings tightly to the branch because, not yet ripe, it's unfit for the palace. When fruits become ripe, sweet, and juicy, then, biting their lips, they loosen their hold. When the mouth has been sweetened by felicity, the kingdom of the world loses it's appeal. To be tightly attached to the world is immaturity. As long as you're an embryo, all you think about is sipping blood. There's more to be said, but let the Holy Spirit tell it. You may even tell it to your own ear. Neither I, nor some other \"I,\" needs to tell you, you who are also I. Just as when you fall asleep, you leave the presence of yourself to enter another presence of yourself. You hear something from yourself and imagine that someone else has secretly spoken to you in a dream. But you are not a single \"you,\" my friend----you are the wide sky and the deep sea. Your awesome \"You,\" which is nine hundredfold, is where a hundred of your you's will drown." ,
"Late, by myself, in the boat of myself, no light and no land anywhere, cloudcover thick. I try to stay just above the surface, yet I'm already under and living within the ocean." ,
"Your faces are very beautiful, but they are wooden cages. You had better run from me. My words are fire." ,
"If you have much, give of your wealth; If you have little, give of your Heart." ,
"You had better run from me. My words are fire." ,
"You're water. We're the millstone. You're wind. We're dust blown up into shapes. You're spirit. We're the opening and closing of our hands. You're the clarity. We're the language that tries to say it. You're joy. We're all the different kinds of laughing." ,
"The Reed Flute's Work I say to the reed flute, You do the work, yet you know sweet secrets too. You share the Friend's breathing. What could you need from me? The reed replies, Knowledge is total destruction. I say, Burn me completely then and leave no knowing. How could I, when it's knowledge that leads us? But this knowledge has lost compassion and grown disgusted with itself. It has forgotten about silence and emptiness. A reed flute has nine holes and is a model of human consciousness, beheaded, though still in love with lips. This is your disgrace, this moaning. Weep for the sounds you make." ,
"I walk into a huge pasture. I nurse the milk of millennia." ,
"There's no one with intelligence in this town except that man over there playing with the children, the one riding the stick horse. He has keen, fiery insight and vast dignity like the night sky, but he conceals it in the madness of child's play." ,
"Wake up: This world that you dream holds nothing to fear." ,
"Sadness to me is the happiest time, When a shining city rises from the ruins of my drunken mind. Those times when I'm silent and still as the earth, The thunder of my roar is heard across the universe." ,
"I thought, \"First I will know you, then I will die.\" He replied, \"Whoever knows Me never dies." ,
"What? Are you still pretending you are separate from the Beloved?" ,
"My wails of sorrow are tormenting my soul" ,
"Die! Die! Die in this love! If you die in this love,Your soul will be renewed. Die! Die! Don't fear the death of that which is known If you die to the temporal, You will become timeless." ,
"You are so weak. Give up to grace. The ocean takes care of each wave till it gets to shore. You need more help than you know." ,
"Come, seek for search is the foundation of every fortune: every success depends on focusing on the heart." ,
"There is a basket of fresh bread on your head, yet you go door to door asking for crusts." ,
"This world hurts my head with its answers. I would burn if I had a choice." ,
"BISMILLAH It's a habit of yours to walk slowly. You hold a grudge for years. With such heaviness, how can you be modest? With such attachments, do you expect to arrive anywhere? Be wide as the air to learn a secret. Right now you're equal portions clay and water, thick mud. Abraham learned how the sun and moon and the stars all set. He said, No longer will I try to assign partners for God. You are so weak. Give up to grace. The ocean takes care of each wave till it gets to shore. You need more help than you know. You're trying to live your life in open scaffolding. Say Bismillah, In the name of God, as the priest does with a knife when he offers an animal. Bismillah your old self to find your real name." ,
"The intelligent desire self-control; children want candy." ,
"Sit, be still, and listen, because you're drunk and we're at the edge of the roof." ,
"Like a sculptor, if necessary, carve a friend out of stone. Realize that your inner sight is blind and try to see a treasure in everyone." ,
"You were sent to unite people You were not been sent to divide people." ,
"Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment. Cleverness is mere opinion, bewilderment is intuition." ,
"Blessed is he who listens with the ear of his heart" ,
"You erased my famine, unpicked my anger Your energy charges my voice, it radiates my heart; Now I am alive with the ore of words pouring From my lips like molten lava glittering with joy." ,
"They fell to, on the ground. You've seen a baker rolling dough. He kneads it gently at first, then more roughly. He pounds it on the board. It softly groans under his palms. Now he spreads it out and rolls it flat. Then he bunches it, and rolls it all the way out again, thin. Now he adds water and mixes it well. Now salt, and a little more salt. Now he shapes itdelicately to its final shape and slides itinto the oven, which is already hot. You remember breadmaking! This is how your desire tangles with a desired one. And it's not justa metaphor for a man and a woman making love. Warriors in battle do this too. A great mutual embrace is always happening between the eternal and what dies, between essence and accident." ,
"Grief can be the garden of compassion. If you keep your heart open through everything, your pain can become your greatest ally in your life's search for love and wisdom" ,
"What talking is for Gather the pieces, so I can show you what is. That's what talking is for, to help us be one. Many-ness is having sixty different emotions. Unity is peace and silence. I know I ought to stop now, but the excitement of this keeps opening my mouth like a sneeze or a yawn does. Muhammad says, I ask forgiveness seventy times a day, and I do the same. Forgive my talking so much, but the way God makes mysteries manifest quickens and keeps the flow of words continual." ,
"There's a morning when presence comes over your soul. You sing like a rooster in your earth-colored shape. Your heart hears and, no longer frantic, begins to dance." ,
"Speak Little. Learn the words of eternity. Go beyond your tangled thoughts and find the splendor of paradise." ,
"I love my friends neither with my heart nor with my mind. Just in case... Heart might stop. Mind can forget. I love them with my soul. Soul never stops or forgets." ,
"As you live Deeper in the Heart, the Mirror gets clearer and cleaner." ,
"Love said to me, there is nothing that is not me. Be silent." ,
"I searched for God and found only myself. I searched for myself and found only God." ,
"Is your face a beautiful blossom or a sweet torture? I have no complaints but my heart is tempted to let you hear of its sorrows." ,
"Which is worth more, a crowd of thousands, or your own genuine solitude? Freedom, or power over an entire nation? A little while alone in your room will prove more valuable than anything else that could ever be given you." ,
"I searched for God among the Christians and on the Cross and therein I found Him not. I went into the ancient temples of idolatry; no trace of Him was there. I entered the mountain cave of Hira and then went as far as Qandhar but God I found not. With set purpose I fared to the summit of Mount Caucasus and found there only 'anqa's habitation. Then I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old and young; God was not there even. Turning to philosophy I inquired about him from ibn Sina but found Him not within his range. I fared then to the scene of the Prophet's experience of a great divine manifestation only a \"two bow-lengths' distance from him\" but God was not there even in that exalted court. Finally, I looked into my own heart and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else." ,
"I Lost Everything, I Have Found Myself." ,

"Soul, if you want to learn secrets, your heart must forget about shame and dignity. You are God's lover, yet you worry what people are saying." ,
"martyred plants from their shrouds. Their mouths" ,
"O Love, O pure deep Love, be here, be now, Be all - worlds dissolve into your stainless endless radiance, Frail living leaves burn with your brighter than cold stares - Make me your servant, your breath, your core." ,
"My dear soul, flee from the worthless, stay close only to those with a pure heart. Like attracts like. A crow will lead you to the graveyard, a parrot to a lump of sugar." ,
"TIME TO SACRIFICE TAURUS This is the night of union when the stars scatter their rice over us. The sky is excited! Venus cannot stop singing the little songs she's making up, like birds in the first warm spring weather. The North Star can't quit looking over at Leo. Pisces is stirring milky dust from the ocean floor. Jupiter rides his horse near Saturn, \"Old man, jump up behind me! The juice is coming back! Think of something happy to shout as we go. \"Mars washes his bloody sword, puts it up, and begins building things. The Aquarian water jar fills, and the Virgin pours it generously. The Pleiades and Libra and Aries have no trembling in them anymore. Scorpio walks out looking for a lover, and so does Sagittarius! This is not crooked walking like the Crab. This is a holiday we've been waiting for. It is finally time to sacrifice Taurus and learn how the sky is a lens to look through. Listen to what's inside what I say. Shams will appear at dawn; then even night will change from its beloved animated darkness to a day within this ordinary sweet daylight." ,
"ON THE DAY I DIE On the day I die, when I'm being carried toward the grave, don't weep. Don't say, He's gone! He's gone. Death has nothing to do with going away. The sun sets and the moon sets, but they're not gone. Death is a coming together. The tomb looks like a prison, but it's really release into union. The human seed goes down in the ground like a bucket into the well where Joseph is. It grows and comes up full of some unimagined beauty. Your mouth closes here, and immediately opens with a shout of joy there. --------------------------------- One who does what the Friend wants done will never need a friend. There's a bankruptcy that's pure gain. The moon stays bright when it doesn't avoid the night. A rose's rarest essence lives in the thorn. ---------------------------------- Childhood, youth, and maturity, and now old age. Every guest agrees to stay three days, no more. Master, you told me to remind you. Time to go. ----------------------------------- The angel of death arrives, and I spring joyfully up. No one knows what comes over me when I and that messenger speak! ------------------------------------- When you come back inside my chest no matter how far I've wandered off, I look around and see the way. At the end of my life, with just one breath left, if you come then, I'll sit up and sing. -------------------------------------- Last night things flowed between us that cannot now be said or written. Only as I'm being carried out and down the road, as the folds of my shroud open in the wind, will anyone be able to read, as on the petal-pages of a turning bud, what passed through us last night. ------------------------------------- I placed one foot on the wide plain of death, and some grand immensity sounded on the emptiness. I have felt nothing ever like the wild wonder of that moment. Longing is the core of mystery. Longing itself brings the cure. The only rule is, Suffer the pain. Your desire must be disciplined, and what you want to happen in time, sacrificed." ,
"Sorrow prepares you for joy. It violently sweeps everything out of your house, so that new joy can find space to enter. It shakes the yellow leaves from the bough of your heart, so that fresh, green leaves can grow in their place. It pulls up the rotten roots, so that new roots hidden beneath have room to grow. Whatever sorrow shakes from your heart, far better things will take their place." ,
"I cannot sleep in your presence In your absence, tears prevent me you watch me my beloved on each sleepiness night and Only you see the difference" ,
"Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames" ,
"Kemarin aku menjadi pintar Aku ingin merubah dunia Hari ini aku menjadi bijak Aku ingin merubah diriku sendiri" ,
"WEAN YOURSELF Little by little, wean yourself. This is the gist of what I have to say. From an embryo, whose nourishment comes in the blood, move to an infant drinking milk, to a child on solid food, to a searcher after wisdom, to a hunter of more invisible game. Think how it is to have a conversation with an embryo. You might say, \"The world outside is vast and intricate. There are wheatfields and mountain passes, and orchards in bloom. At night there are millions of galaxies, and in sunlight the beauty of friends dancing at a wedding.\" You ask the embryo why he, or she, stays cooped up in the dark with eyes closed. Listen to the answer. There is no \"other world.\" I only know what I've experienced. You must be hallucinating." ,
"This place is a dream. Only a sleeper considers it real. Then death comes like dawn, and you wake up laughing at what you thought was your grief." ,
"Let yourself be silently drawn by the inner pull of what you really love." ,
"In compassion and grace, be like the sun... In concealing other's faults, be like the night... In generosity and helping others, be like a river... In anger and fury, be like dead... In modesty and humility, be like the earth... In tolerance, be like the sea... Either appear as you are, or be as you appear.." ,
"The gates made of light swing open. You see in." ,
"I saw many humans on whom there were no clothes, I saw many clothes in which there were no humans." ,
"Let yourself becoming living poetry" ,
"My soul is from elsewhere, I'm sure of that, and I intend to end up there. This drunkenness began in some other tavern. When I get back around to that place, I'll be completely sober." ,
"the soul has been given it's own ears to hear things the mind does not understand." ,
"You will learn by reading, But you will understand with LOVE." ,
"I want a trouble-maker for a lover, blood spiller, blood drinker, a heart of flame, who quarrels with the sky and fights with fate, who burns like fire on the rushing sea." ,
"look what they've done to me; I am disheveled, bewildered, confused. Now please take my hand. I am wandering about, in awe and amazement of you. Take my hand. Everyone has someone to take care for them. But look at me: I have no one. Take my hand" ,
"Keep on knocking 'til the joy inside opens a window look to see who's there" ,
"When you go through a hard period, When everything seems to oppose you, ... When you feel you cannot even bear one more minute, NEVER GIVE UP! Because it is the time and place that the course will divert!" ,
"We may know who we are or we may not We may be Muslims, Jews or Christians but until our hearts become the mould for every for every heart we will only see our differences" ,
"Why are you so afraid of silence, silence is the root of everything. If you spiral into its void, a hundred voices will thunder messages you long to hear" ,
"When you do things from your soul, you feel a river moving in you, a joy." ,
"Move outside the tangle of fear-thinking. Live in silence." ,
"Moonlight floods the whole sky from horizon to horizon; How much it can fill your room depends on its windows." ,
"Speak a new language so that the world will be a new world." ,
"I was dead i came alive i was tears i became laughter all because of love when it arrived my temporal life from then on changed to eternal love said to me you are not crazy enough you don\'t fit this house i went and became crazy crazy enough to be in chains love said you are not intoxicated enough you don\'t fit the group i went and got drunk drunk enough to overflow with light-headedness love said you are still too clever filled with imagination and skepticism i went and became gullible and in fright pulled away from it all love said you are a candle attracting everyone gathering every one around you i am no more a candle spreading light i gather no more crowds and like smoke i am all scattered now love said you are a teacher you are a head and for everyone you are a leader i am no more not a teacher not a leader just a servant to your wishes love said you already have your own wings i will not give you more feathers and then my heart pulled itself apart and filled to the brim with a new light overflowed with fresh life now even the heavens are thankful that because of love i have become the giver of light." ,
"This place is a dream. Only a sleeper considers it real. Then death comes like dawn, and you wake up laughing at what you thought was your grief. But there\'s a difference with this dream. Everything cruel and unconscious done in the illusion of the present world, all that does not fade away at the death-waking. It stays, and it must be interpreted. All the mean laughing, all the quick, sexual wanting, those torn coats of Joseph, they change into powerful wolves that you must face. The retaliation that sometimes comes now, the swift, payback hit, is just a boy's game to what the other will be. You know about circumcision here. It's full castration there! And this groggy time we live, this is what it's like: A man goes to sleep in the town where he has always lived, and he dreams he's living in another town. In the dream, he doesn't remember the town he's sleeping in his bed in. He believes the reality of the dream town. The world is that kind of sleep. The dust of many crumbled cities settles over us like a forgetful doze, but we are older than those cities. We began as a mineral. We emerged into plant life and into animal state, and then into being human, and always we have forgotten our former states, except in early spring when we slightly recall being green again. That's how a young person turns toward a teacher. That's how a baby leans toward the breast, without knowing the secret of its desire, yet turning instinctively. Humankind is being led along an evolving course, through this migration of intelligences, and though we seem to be sleeping, there is an inner wakefulness that directs the dream, and that will eventually startle us back to the truth of who we are." ,
"All religions. All this singing. One song. Peace be with you." ,
"Without you the instruments would die. One sits close beside you. Another takes a long kiss. The tambourine begs, Touch my skin so I can be myself. Let me feel you enter each limb bone by bone, that what died last night can be whole today. Why live some soberer way, and feel you ebbing out? I won't do it. Either give me enough wine or leave me alone, now that I know how it is to be with you in constant conversation." ,
"PARADOX Paradoxes: best wakefulness in sleep, wealth in having nothing, a pearl necklace fastened around an iron collar. Fire contained in boiling water. Revenues growing from funds flowing out. Giving is gainful employment. It brings in money. Taking time for ritual prayer and meditation saves time. Sweet fruit hide in leaves. Dung becomes food for the ground and generative power in trees. Nonexistence contains existence. Love encloses beauty. Brown flint and gray steel have orange candlelight in them. Inside fear, safety. In the black pupil of the eye, many brilliancies. Inside the body-cow, a handsome prince." ,
"The heart has its own language. The heart knows a hundred thousand ways to speak." ,
"WHY CLING Why cling to one life till it is soiled and ragged? The sun dies and dies squandering a hundred lived every instant God has decreed life for you and He will give another and another and another" , 
"The rose's rarest essence lives in the thorns." ,
"We love that s why life is full of so many wonderful gifts." ,
"A woman is a beam of the divine light she is not the being whom sensual desire takes as it's object she is a creator it should be said she is not a creature she is infinite love." ,
"LOVE IS THE MASTER Love is the One who masters all things; I am mastered totally by Love. By my passion of love for Love I have ground sweet as sugar. O furious Wind, I am only a straw before you; How could I know where I will be blown next? Whoever claims to have made a pact with Destiny Reveals himself a liar and a fool; What is any of us but a straw in a storm? How could anyone make a pact with a hurricane? God is working everywhere his massive Resurrection; How can we pretend to act on our own? In the hand of Love I am like a cat in a sack; Sometimes Love hoists me into the air, Sometimes Love flings me into the air, Love swings me round and round His head; I have no peace, in this world or any other. The lovers of God have fallen in a furious river; They have surrendered themselves to Love's commands. Like mill wheels they turn, day and night, day and night, Constantly turning and turning, and crying out." ,
"But can you think of anyone who's not hazy with smoke?" ,
"Art thou really she For whom Majnun lost his head and went distracted? Thou art not fairer than many other fair ones.\" She replied, \"Be silent; thou art not Majnun!\" If thou hadst Majnun's eyes, The two worlds would be within thy view. Thou art in thy senses, but Majnun is beside himself. In love to be wide awake is treason. The more a man is awake, the more he sleeps (to love); His (critical) wakefulness is worse than slumbering. Our wakefulness fetters our spirits, Then our souls are a prey to divers whims, Thoughts of loss and gain and fears of misery. They retain not purity, nor dignity, nor lustre, Nor aspiration to soar heavenwards. That one is really sleeping who hankers after each whim And holds parley with each fancy." ,
"When I am with you, we stay up all night. When you're not here, I can't go to sleep. Praise God for these two insomnias! And the difference between them. The minute I heard my first love story I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along. We are the mirror as well as the face in it. We are tasting the taste this minute of eternity. We are pain and what cures pain, both. We are the sweet cold water and the jar that pours. I want to hold you close like a lute, so we can cry out with loving. You would rather throw stones at a mirror? I am your mirror, and here are the stones." ,
"I am merely a guest born in this world, to know the secrets that lie beyond it." ,
"Your body is away from me, but there is a window open from my heart to yours." ,
"Wherever you stand, be the Soul of that place." ,
"I went inside my heart to see how it was. Something there makes me hear the whole world weeping." ,
"Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing there is a field. I'll meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about." ,
"A pen went scribbling along. When it tried to write love, it broke." ,
"When you are everywhere, you are nowhere When you are somewhere, you are everywhere." ,
"A lover has four streams inside, of water, wine, honey, and milk. Find those in yourself, and pay no attention what so-and-so says about such-and-such. The rose does not care if someone calls it a thorn, or a jasmine. Ordinary eyes categorize human beings, That one is a Zoroastrian. This one, Muslim. Walk instead with the other vision given you, your first eyes." ,
"THE INTEREST WITHOUT THE CAPITAL The lover's food is the love of the bread; no bread need be at hand: no one who is sincere in his love is a slave to existence. Lovers have nothing to do with with with existence; lovers have the interest without the capital. Without wings they fly around the world; without hands they carry the polo ball off the field. That dervish who caught the scent of Reality used to weave basket even though his hand had been cut off. Lover have pitched their tents in nonexistence: they are of one quality and one essence, as nonexistence is." , 
"Come, come, whoever you are, wanderer, worshiper, lover of leaving, it doesn't matter. Ours is not a caravan of despair. Come, even if you have broken your vow a hundred times. Come, come again, come." ,
"I ask a flower, \"How is it you are so wise so young?\" \"With the first morning wind and the first dew, I lost my innocence.\" I follow the one who showed me the way. I extend one hand up, and with the other I touch the ground. A great branch leans down from the sky. How long will I keep talking of up and down? This is not my home: silence, annihilation, absence! I go back where everything is nothing." ,
"Everyone has been made for some particular work, and the desire for that work has been put in every heart. Let yourself be silently drawn by the stronger pull of what you really love." ,
"Oh my friend, all that you see of me is a shell, the rest belongs to love." ,
"Oh soul, you worry too much. You have seen your own strength. You have seen your own beauty. You have seen your golden wings. Of anything less, why do you worry? You are in truth the soul, of the soul, of the soul." ,
"Der Elefant, der gestern im Traume Indien sah, Sprang aus der Fessel - wer hat, ihn festzuhalten, Macht?" ,
"You are the Universe in Ecstatic Motion" ,
"Someone who does not run toward the allure of love walks a road where nothing lives." ,
"For years I pulled my own existence out of emptiness. Then one swoop, one swing of the arm, that work is over. Free of who I was, free of presence, free of dangerous fear, hope, free of mountainous wanting. The here-and-now mountain is a tiny piece of a piece of straw blown off into emptiness." ,
"Look past your thoughts, so you may drink the pure nectar of This Moment." ,
"Remember, the entrance door to the sanctuary is inside you." ,
"Pertanyaan dari hati hanya bisa dijawab oleh jawaban dari hati" ,
"A Marriage at Daybreak Do you know, brother, that you are a prince? A son of Adam. And that the witch of Kabul, who holds you with her color and her perfume, is the world? Say the words, I take refuge with the Lord of the Daybreak. Avoid the hot breathing that keeps you tied to her. She breathes on knots and no one can unknot them. That's why the prophets came. Look for those whose breath is cool. When they breathe on knots, they loosen. The old woman of the world has had you in her net for sixty years. Her breathing is the breathing of God's anger. But God's mercy has more strength. Mercy is prior to wrath. You must marry your soul. That wedding is the way. Union with the world is sickness. But it's hard to be separated from these forms! You don't have enough patience to give this up? But how do you have enough patience to do without God? You can't quit drinking the earth's dark drink? But how can you not drink from this other fountain? You get restless, you say, when you don't sip the world's fermentation. But if for one second you saw the beauty of the clear water of God, you'd think this other was embalming fluid. Nearness to the Beloved is the splendor of your life. Marry the Beloved. Let the thorn of the ego slide from your foot. What a relief to be empty! Then God can live your life. When you stay tied to mind and desire, you stumble in the mud like a nearsighted donkey. Keep smelling Joseph's shirt. Don't be satisfied with borrowed light. Let your brow and your face illuminate with union." ,
"Look for the answer inside your question." ,
"I choose to love you in silence... For in silence I find no rejection, I choose to love you in loneliness... For in loneliness no one owns you but me, I choose to adore you from a distance... For distance will shield me from pain, I choose to kiss you in the wind... For the wind is gentler than my lips, I choose to hold you in my dreams... For in my dreams, you have no end." ,
"You think you are alive because you breathe air? Shame on you, that you are alive in such a limited way. Don't be without Love, so you won't feel dead. Die in Love and stay alive forever." ,
"No need to announce the future! This now is it. This. Your deepest need and desire is satisfied by the moment's energy here in your hand." ,
"They say there is a doorway from heart to heart, but what is the use of a door when there are no walls?" ,

"Lightning, your presence from ground to sky, no one knows what becomes of me, when you take me so quickly." ,
"You are not a drop in the ocean, you are the entire ocean in a drop." ,
"Flow down and down in always widening rings of being." ,
"Never lose hope, my heart, miracles dwell in the invisible. If the whole world turns against you keep your eyes on the Friend." ,
"A strange passion is moving in my head My heart has become a bird which searches in the sky. Every part of me goes in different directions. Is it really so that the one I love is Everywhere?" ,
"I worship the moon. Tell me of the soft glow of a candle light and the sweetness of my moon." ,
"THE LEVEL OF WORDS God has said, \"The images that come with human language do not correspond to me, but those who love words must use them to come near.\" Just remember, it's like saying of the king, \"He is not a weaver.\" Is that praise? Whatever such a statement is, words are on THAT level of God-knowing." ,

"If I could repeat it, people passing by would be enlightened and go free." ,
"Stars burn clear all night till dawn. Do that yourself, and a spring will rise in the dark with water your deepest thirst is for." ,
"Listen, open the heart's window and keep looking at the Beloved. The task of love is to open that window so the heart can be illuminated by His Beauty. Gaze incessantly at the Beloved's face. That is your power, my friend" ,
"Woman is a beam of the divine Light. She is not the being whom sensual desires takes as its object. She is Creator, it should be said. She is not a creature. Great Fatima-ul- Zehra ( Means of Fatima the Radiant, Brightest Star, Star of Venus, The Evening Star), the daughter of the Prophet, is the secret in Sufism. She is the Hujjat of Ali (JJ). In other words, she establishes the esoteric sense of his knowledge and guides those who attain to it. Through her perfume, we breathe paradise. Though she was his daughter, the Prophet Muhammad (SAWW) called her \"Um Abi'ha\" (mother of her father). What mystery was the Prophet hinting at by this statement? While Fatima Zahra ( Salam -ullah - alleha ) was Muhammad's (SAWW) daughter. The spiritual Fatima Al-Batool ( the divine virgin) her house is the living Ka'ba." ,
"Let yourself be drawn by the stronger pull of that which you truly love." ,
"In the slaughterhouse of love, they kill only the best, none of the weak or deformed. Don't run away from this dying. Whoever's not killed for love is dead meat." ,
"You have seen what Eblis the accursed has seen, when he said \"I am of fire, while Adam is of clay.\" Cover up the Eblis-like eye for just a moment; how long will you see just the form? How long, indeed, how long? Alas for that eye that's blind and bruised! Within it the sun seemed like an atom Of an Adam who had no like. He saw nothing but a lump of clay." , 
"Advice doesn't help lovers! They're not the kind of mountain stream you can build a dam across." ,
"Don't grieve. Anything you lose comes round in another form." ,
"Are you fleeing from love because of a single humiliation? What do you know of love except the name? Love has a hundred forms of pride and disdain, and is gained by a hundred means of persuasion. Since love is loyal, it purchases one who is loyal: it has no interest in a disloyal companion" ,
"Reason says, I will beguile him with the tongue;\" Love says, \"Be silent. I will beguile him with the soul.\" The soul says to the heart, \"Go, do not laugh at me and yourself. What is there that is not his, that I may beguile him thereby?\" He is not sorrowful and anxious and seeking oblivion that I may beguile him with wine and a heavy measure. The arrow of his glance needs not a bow that I should beguile the shaft of his gaze with a bow. He is not prisoner of the world, fettered to this world of earth, that I should beguile him with gold of the kingdom of the world. He is an angel, though in form he is a man; he is not lustful that I should beguile him with women. Angels start away from the house wherein this form is, so how should I beguile him with such a form and likeness? He does not take a flock of horses, since he flies on wings; his food is light, so how should I beguile him with bread? He is not a merchant and trafficker in the market of the world that I should beguile him with enchantment of gain and loss. He is not veiled that I should make myself out sick and utter sighs, to beguile him with lamentation. I will bind my head and bow my head, for I have got out of hand; I will not beguile his compassion with sickness or fluttering. Hair by hair he sees my crookedness and feigning; what's hidden from him that I should beguile him with anything hidden. He is not a seeker of fame, a prince addicted to poets, that I should beguile him with verses and lyrics and flowing poetry. The glory of the unseen form is too great for me to beguile it with blessing or Paradise. Shams-e Tabriz, who is his chosen and beloved - perchance I will beguile him with this same pole of the age." ,
"What is a saint? One whose wine has turned to vinegar. If you're still wine-drunkenly brave, don't step forward. When your sheep becomes a lion, then come. It is said of hypocrites, \"They have considerable valor among themselves!\" But they scatter when a real enemy appears. Muhammad told his young soldiers, \"There is no courage before an engagement.\" A drunk foams at the mouth talking about what he will do when he gets his sword drawn, but the chance arrives, and he remains sheathed as an onion. Premeditating, he's eager for wounds. Then his bag gets touched by a needle, and he deflates. What sort of person says that he or she wants to be polished and pure, then complains about being handled roughly? Love is a lawsuit where harsh evidence must be brought in. To settle the case, the judge must see evidence. You've heard that every buried treasure has a snake guarding it. Kiss the snake to discover the treasure! The severe treatment is not toward you, but the qualities that block your growth. A rug beater doesn't beat the rug, but rather the dirt. A horse trainer switches not the horse, but the going wrong. Imprison your mash in a dark vat, so it can become wine. Someone asks, \"Don't you worry about God\'s wrath when you spank a child?\" \"I\'m not spanking my child, but the demon in him.\" When a mother screams, \"Get out of here!\" she means the mean part of the child. Don\'t run from those who scold, and don\'t turn away from cleansing conflict, or you will remain weak. Also, don\'t listen to bragging. If you go along with self-importance, the work collapses. Better a small modest team. Sift almonds. Discard the bitter. Sour and sweet sound alike when you pour them out on the rattling tray, but inside they're very different." ,
"One Whisper of the Beloved Lovers share a sacred decree - to seek the Beloved. They roll head over heels, rushing toward the Beautiful One like a torrent of water In truth, everyone is a shadow of the Beloved - Our seeking is His seeking, Our words are His words. At times we flow toward the Beloved like a dancing stream. At times we are still water held in His pitcher. At times we boil in a pot turning to vapor - that is the job of the Beloved. He breathes into my ear until my soul takes on His fragrance. He is the soul of my soul - How can I escape? But why would any soul in this world want to escape from the Beloved? He will melt your pride making you thin as a strand of hair, Yet do not trade, even for both worlds, One strand of His hair. We search for Him here and there while looking right at Him. Sitting by His side we ask, \"O Beloved, where is the Beloved?\" Enough with such questions! - Let silence take you to the core of life. All your talk is worthless When compared to one whisper of the Beloved." ,
"You cannot hide love Love will get on its way To the heart of someone you love Far or near, it goes home To where it belongs To the heart of lovers" ,
"Some people say about human beings, 'Dust to dust'. But how can that be true of one who changes road dust to doorway? The crop appears to be one thing when it is still in the field. Then the transformation time comes, and we see how it is: half chaff, half grain." ,
"Show me your face i crave flowers and gardens open your lips i crave the taste of honey come out from behind the clouds i desire a sunny face your voice echoed saying \"leave me alone\" i wish to hear your voice again saying \"leave me alone\" i swear this city without you is a prison i am dying to get out to roam in deserts and mountains i am tired of flimsy friends and submissive companions i die to walk with the brave am blue hearing nagging voices and meek cries i desire loud music drunken parties and wild dance one hand holding a cup of wine one hand caressing your hair then dancing in orbital circle that is what i yearn for i can sing better than any nightingale but because of this city's freaks i seal my lips while my heart weeps yesterday the wisest man holding a lit lantern in daylight was searching around town saying i am tired of all these beasts and brutes i seek a true human we have all looked for one but no one could be found they said yes he replied but my search is for the one who cannot be found" ,
"May the blessings which flow in all weddings be gathered, God, together in our wedding! The blessings of the Night of Power, the month of fasting the festival to break the fast the blessings of the meeting of Adam and Eve the blessings of the meeting of Joseph and Jacob the blessings of gazing on the paradise of all abodes and yet another blessing which cannot be put in words: the fruitful scattering of joy of the children of the Shayak and our eldest! In companionship and happiness may you be like milk and honey in union and fidelity, just like sugar and halva. May the blessings of those who toast and the one who pours the wine anoint the ones who said Amen and the one who said the prayer" ,
"Those with lives filled with laughter and sorrow, Have no choice but to live between the two, in borrow. Where is the green garden of love, that's infinite? More than sorrow and laughter, plenty of fruits in it." ,
"I said: How can such an ocean be contained in a jar? He replied: \"How can you even grasp the understanding of the how and the means of this? Who can come to realize the mastery of the work that has no like?!... Inside the limited, He lays the world of infinity." ,
"The sound of salaams rising as waves diminish down in prayer, hoping for some trace of the one whose trace does not appear. If anyone asks you to say who you are, say without hesitation, soul withing soul within soul. There's a pearl diver who does not know how to swim! No matter. Pearls are handed him on the beach. We lovers laugh to hear, \"This should be more that and that more this,\"coming from people sitting in a wagon tilted in a ditch. Going in search of the heart, I found a huge rose under my feet, and roses under all our feet! How to say this to someone who denies it? The robe we wear is the sky's cloth. Everything is soul and flowering. --------------------------------- I open and fill with love and other objects evaporate. All the learning in books stays put on the shelf. Poetry, the dear words and images of song, comes down over me like mountain water. ---------------------------------- Any cup I hold fills with wine that lovers drink. Every word I say opens into mystery. Any way I turn I see brilliance." ,
"You consider issues, but not deeply enough. Your spring is frozen. Faith is a flowing. Don't try to forge cold iron. Study David, the ironsmith, and dancer, and musician. Move into the sun. You're wrapped in fantasy and inner mumbling. When spirit enters, a man begins to wander freely, escaped and overrunning through the garden plants, spontaneous and soaking in. Now a miracle story..." ,
"Is it really so that the one I love is everywhere?" ,
"We gather at night to celebrate being human. Sometimes we call out low to the tambourine. Fish drink the sea, but the sea does not get smaller! We eat the clouds and evening light. We are slaves tasting the royal wine." ,

"You are a lover of your own experience ... not of me ... you turn to me to feel ur own emotion" ,
"All night, a man called out \"God! God!\" Until his lips were bleeding. Then the Adversary of mankind said, \"Hey! Mr Gullible! ... How come you've been calling all night And never once heard God say, \"Here, I AM\"? You call out so earnestly and, in reply, what? I'll tell you what. Nothing!\" The man suddenly felt empty and abandoned. Depressed, he threw himself on the ground And fell into a deep sleep. In a dream, he met an angel, who asked, \"Why are you regretting calling out to God?\" The man said, \" I called and called But God never replied, \"Here I AM.\" The Angel explained, \"God has said, \"Your calling my name is My reply. Your longing for Me is My message to you. All your attempts to reach Me Are in reality My attempts to reach you. Your fear and love are a noose to catch Me. In the silence surrounding every call of \"God\" Waits a thousand replies of \"Here I AM." ,

"May this marriage be blessed. May this marriage be as sweet as milk and honey. May this marriage be as intoxicating as old wine. May this marriage be fruitful like a date tree. May this marriage be full of laughter and everyday a paradise. May this marriage be a seal of compassion for here and hereafter. May this marriage be as welcome as the full moon in the night sky. Listen lovers, now you go on, as I become silent and kiss this blessed night." ,
"This silence, this moment, every moment, if it's genuinely inside you, brings what you need. There's nothing to believe. Only when I stopped believing in myself did I come into this beauty. Sit quietly, and listen for a voice that will say, 'Be more silent.' Die and be quiet. Quietness is the surest sign that you've died. Your old life was a frantic running from silence. Move outside the tangle of fear-thinking. Live in silence." ,
"When you seek Love with all your Heart, you shall find its echoes in the universe." ,
"Why should I be unhappy? Every parcel of my being is in full bloom." ,
"Gamble everything for love, if you're a true human being." ,
"Eblis said, \"No man who thinks ill, will hear the truth despite a hundred signs. When one who fantasises is presented with reason his fantasies increase. When one talks to such a person, their words become the very cause of that person's fantasy. The crusader's sword is a tool for a thief. So the response to him is silence and peace; to talk with an idiot is insanity.",

"O SUN, fill our house once more with light! Make happy all your friends and blind your foes! Rise from behind the hill, transform the stones To rubies and the sour grapes to wine! O Sun, make our vineyard fresh again, And fill the steppes with houris and green cloaks! Physician of the lovers, heaven's lamp! Rescus the lovers! Help the suffering! Show but your face - the world is filled with light! But if you cover it, it's the darkest night" ,
"We can't help being thirsty, moving toward the voice of water." ,
"THIS TORTURE Why should we tell you our love stories when you spill them together like blood in the dirt? Love is a pearl lost on the ocean floor, or a fire we can't see, but how does saying that push us through the top of the head into the light above the head? Love is no tan iron pot, so this boiling energy won't help. Soul, heart, self. Beyond and within those is one saying, How long before I'm free of this torture!" ,
"The cure for the pain is in the pain." ,
"We may know who we are or we may not. We may be Muslims, Jews or Christians but until our hearts become the mould for every heart we will see only our differences." ,

"Bitter your acts, bitter am I, Kindness your deeds, kindness am I, Pleasant and gentle, so you are, Fine honeyed lips and sweet talker." ,
"Today, you have been inside my eyes all day. I am confused, upside down. You are so near and so obvious, I feel apart from you. I am so aware of you, I know nothing." ,
"At the twilight, a moon appeared in the sky; Then it landed on earth to look at me. Like a hawk stealing a bird at the time of prey; That moon stole me and rushed back into the sky. I looked at myself, I did not see me anymore; For in that moon, my body turned as fine as soul. The nine spheres disappeared in that moon; The ship of my existence drowned in that sea." ,
"You left ground and sky weeping, mind and soul full of grief. No one can take your place in existence, or in absence. Both mourn, the angels, the prophets, and this sadness I feel has taken from me the taste of language, so that I cannot say the flavor of my being apart." ,
"IGNORANCE I didn't know love would make me this crazy, with my eyes like the river Ceyhun carrying me in its rapids out to sea,where every bit of shattered boat sinks to the bottom. An alligator lifts its head and swallows the ocean, then the ocean floor becomes a desert covering the alligator in sand drifts. Changes do happen. I do not know how, or what remains of what has disappeared into the absolute. I hear so many stories and explanations, but I keep quiet, because I don't know anything, and because something I swallowed in the ocean has made me completely content with ignorance." ,
"This earth eats men and women, and yet we are sent to eat the world, this place that tries to fool us with tomorrow. Wait until tomorrow, which we outwit by enjoying only this now. We gather at night to celebrate being human. Sometimes we call out low to the tambourine. Fish drink the sea, but the sea does not get smaller! We eat the clouds and evening light. We are slaves tasting the royal wine." ,
"This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First, to let go of life. In the end, to take a step without feet; to regard this world as invisible, and to disregard what appears to be the self. Heart, I said, what a gift it has been to enter this circle of lovers, to see beyond seeing itself, to reach and feel within the breast." ,
"Hardship may dishearten at first, but every hardship passes away. All despair is followed by hope; all darkness is followed by sunshine." ,
"I hang here like Hallaj, feeling those lips on me, the honor of being lifted up on a crucifixion apple tree. Now the kissing is over. Fold your love in. Hide it like pastry filling. Whisper within with a shy girl's tenderness" , 
"You think of yourself as a citizen of the universe. You think you belong to this world of dust and matter. Out of this dust you have created a personal image, and have forgotten about the essence of your true origin" ,

"I say, Show me the way. You say, Put your head under your feet. That way you rise through the stars and see a hundred different ways to be with me." ,
"You are the drop,and the ocean you are kindness,you are anger, you are sweetness,you are poison. Do not make me more disheartened. you are the chamber of the sun, you are the abode of venus, you are the garden of all hope. Oh, Beloved, let me enter." ,
"This We Have Now This we have no is not imagination. This is not grief or joy. Not a judging state, or an elation, or sadness. Those come and go. This is the presence that doesn't. It's dawn, Husam, here in the splendor of coral, inside the Friend, the simple truth of what Hallaj said. What else could human beings want? When grapes turn to wine they're wanting this. When the nightsky pours by, it's really a crowd of beggars, and they all want some of this! This that we are now created the body, cell by cell, like bees building a honeycomb. The human body and the universe grew from this, not this from the universe and the human body." ,
"How long will you think about this painful life? How long will you think about this harmful world? The only thing it can take from you is your body. Don't say all this rubbish and stop thinking." ,
"If I gaze at my beloved she may feel embarrassed and if I do not, she will feel neglected. I can see the stars reflecting in the calm water of her face but if I look away I lose my clarity." ,
"God called the Prophet Muhammad Muzzammil, \"The One Who Wraps Himself,\" and said, \"Come out from under your cloak, you so fond of hiding and running away. Don't cover your face. The world is a reeling, drunken body, and you are its intelligent head. Don't hide the candle of your clarity. Stand up and burn through the night, my prince. Without your light a great lion is held captive by a rabbit! Be the captain of the ship, Mustafa, my chosen one, my expert guide. Look how the caravan of civilization has been ambushed. Fools are everywhere in charge. Do not practice solitude like Jesus. Be in the assembly, and take charge of it. As the bearded griffin, the Humay, lives on Mt. Qaf because he's native to it, so you should live most naturally out in public and be a communal teacher of souls." ,
"Maybe you are searching among the branches, for what only appears in the roots." ,

"Without demolishing religious schools (madrassahs) and minarets and without abandoning the beliefs and ideas of the medieval age, restriction in thoughts and pains in conscience will not end. Without understanding that unbelief is a kind of religion, and that conservative religious belief a kind of disbelief, and without showing tolerance to opposite ideas, one cannot succeed. Those who look for the truth will accomplish the mission. Mevlana Jalal ad-Din RUMI" ,

"Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray." ,
"Gardening Work There was a man breaking up the ground, getting ready to plant, when another man came by, \"Why are you ruining this land?\" \"Don't interfere. Nothing can grow here until the earth is turned over and crumbled. There can be no roses and no orchard without first this devastation. You must lance an ulcer to heal. You must tear down parts of an old building to restore it.\" So it is with the sensual life that has no spirit. A person must face the dragon of his or her appetites with another dragon, the life energy of the soul. When that's not strong, everyone seems to be full of fear and wanting, as one thinks the room is spinning when one's whirling around. If your love has contracted into anger, the atmosphere itself feels threatening, but when you're expansive and clear, no matter what the weather, you're in an open windy field with friends. Many people travel as far as Syria and Iraq and meet only hypocrites. Others go all the way to India and see only people buying and selling. Others travel to Turkestan and China to discover those countries are full of cheats and sneak thieves. You always see the qualities that live in you. A cow may walk through the amazing city of Baghdad and notice only a watermelon rind and a tuft of hay that fell off a wagon. Don't repeatedly keep doing what your lowest self wants. That's like deciding to be a strip of meat nailed to dry on a board in the sun." ,

"Know the true definition of yourself. That is essential. Then, when you know your own definition, flee from it." ,
"Ali In Battle Learn from Ali how to fight without your ego participating. God's Lion did nothing that didn't originate from his deep center. Once in battle he got the best of a certain knight and quickly drew his sword. The man, helpless on the ground, spat in Ali's face. Ali dropped his sword, relaxed, and helped the man to his feet. \"Why have you spared me? How has lightning contracted back into its cloud? Speak, my prince, so that my soul can begin to stir in me like an embryo.\" Ali was quiet and then finally answered, \"I am God's Lion, not the lion of passion. The sun is my lord. I have no longing except for the One. When a wind of personal reaction comes, I do not go along with it. There are many winds full of anger, and lust and greed. They move the rubbish around, but the solid mountain of true nature stays where it's always been. There's nothing now except the divine qualities. Come through the opening into me. Your impudence was better than any reverence, because in this moment I am you and you are me. I give you this opened heart as God gives gifts: the poison of your spit has become the honey of friendship." ,
"Forgive me, that I cannot sleep; forgive The thirsty ones that they have no water. Forgive: if you never know forgiveness, You'll never know the blessings that God gives" ,
"Limp along until your legs are spent, and you fall flat and your energy is drained. Then the grace of the Divine will lift you." ,
"An eye is meant to see things. The soul is here for its own joy. A head has one use: For loving a true love. Feet: To chase after. Love is for vanishing into the sky. The mind, for learning what men have done and tried to do. Mysteries are not to be solved: The eye goes blind when it only wants to see why. A lover is always accused of something. But when he finds his love, whatever was lost in the looking comes back completely changed." ,
"I wonder from these thousand of \"me's\", which one am I? Listen to my cry, do not drown my voice I am completely filled with the thought of you. Don't lay broken glass on my path I will crush it into dust. I am nothing, just a mirror in the palm of your hand, reflecting your kindness, your sadness, your anger. If you were a blade of grass or a tiny flower I will pitch my tent in your shadow. Only your presence revives my withered heart. You are the candle that lights the whole world and I am an empty vessel for your light.",
"The cure for pain is in the pain." ,
"I made an oath to myself: as long as I live as long as my soul remains in this body I won't deviate from the right way but later I looked to my left and then to my right and I saw our beloved everywhere how could I make a wrong turn?" ,

"You have seen your own strength. You have seen your own beauty. You have seen your golden wings. Why do you worry?" ,
"My lips got lost on the way to the kiss - that's how drunk I was." ,
"You were born with wings, why prefer to crawl through life?" ,
"if i can only recount the story of my life right out of my body flames will grow" ,
"Be helpless, dumbfounded, Unable to say yes or no. Then a stretcher will come from grace to gather us up. We are too dull-eyed to see that beauty. If we say we can, we're lying. If we say No, we don't see it, That No will behead us And shut tight our window onto spirit. So let us rather not be sure of anything, Beside ourselves, and only that, so Miraculous beings come running to help. Crazed, lying in a zero circle, mute, We shall be saying finally, With tremendous eloquence, Lead us. When we have totally surrendered to that beauty, We shall be a mighty kindness." ,

"HOW SHOULD THE SOUL not take wings when from the Glory of God It hears a sweet, kindly call: \"Why are you here, soul? Arise!\" How should a fish not leap fast into the sea from dry land When from the ocean so cool the sound of the waves reaches its How should the falcon not fly back to his king from the hunt When from the falconer's drum it hears to call: \"Oh, come back\"? Why should not every Sufi begin to dance atom-like Around the Sun of duration that saves from impermanence? What graciousness and what beauty? What life-bestowing! What grace! If anyone does without that, woe- what err, what suffering! Oh fly , of fly, O my soul-bird, fly to your primordial home! You have escaped from the cage now- your wings are spread in the air. Oh travel from brackish water now to the fountain of life! Return from the place of the sandals now to the high seat of souls! Go on! Go on! we are going, and we are coming, O soul, From this world of separation to union, a world beyond worlds! How long shall we here in the dust-world like children fill our skirts With earth and with stones without value, with broken shards without worth? Let's take our hand from the dust grove, let's fly to the heavens' high, Let's fly from our childish behaviour and join the banquet of men! Call out, O soul, to proclaim now that you are rules and king! You have the grace of the answer, you know the question as well!" ,

"Love is nothing but felicity and loving kindness, It is nothing but gladness and right guidance." ,
"Don't worry about saving these songs! And if one of our instruments breaks, it doesn't matter. We have fallen into the place where everything is music.

"Into this new love, die your way begins on the other side become the sky take an axe to the prison wall, escape walk out like someone suddenly born into color do it now" ,
"Every moment a taste of that beauty in our mouths, another stashed in a pocket. Impossible to say what: no cypress so handsome, no sunlight, a lonely hiddenness. Other pleasure gathers a crowd, starts a fight, lots of noise there. But soul beauty stays quiet..his amazing whereabouts unknown inside my heart." ,

Inside the majesty." ,
"O Friend! we are near you in friendship, Wherever you set foot, we prostrate ourselves like earth. How is it permissible, in the religion of love, That we should see your Creation and neglect to see You? That Friend brought me up with great care and attention; He sewed me a garment from skin and veins. The body is like a cloak and my heart in it like a mystic, The world is like a monastery and He is my Guide. Seek knowledge which unravels mysteries Before your life comes to close Give up that non-existence which looks like existence, Seek that Existence which looks like non-existence! There is a world outside Islam and Disbelief, We are enamoured of the atmosphere therein. The mystic lays down his head when he reaches there. There is neither Islam nor Disbelief in this place. Whenever I prostrate my head He is the one to whom I bow; In six directions or outside the six, he is the one I worship. The garden, the rose, the nightingale, music and the beauteous maiden Are a mere excuse and He alone is the real object." ,

"Ali and the woman whose baby crawled out on the roof A woman comes to Ali. My baby has crawled out on the roof near the water drain, where I cannot go. He won't listen to me. I talk, but he doesn't understand language. I make gestures. I show him my breast, but he turns away. What can I do? Take another baby his age up to the roof. The woman does, and the child sees his friend and crawls away from the edge. The prophets are human for this reason, that we may see them and delight in their friendly presence, and crawl away from the downspout. Muhammad calls himself a man like you. Likeness is a great drawing force. Those of mean dispositions learn hatred from each other, and they try to draw others in. Anyone whose haystack has burned does not enjoy seeing someone else's candle lit." ,

"When the rose is gone and the garden faded you will no longer hear the nightingale's song. The Beloved is all; the lover just a veil. The Beloved is living; the lover a dead thing. If love withholds its strengthening care, the lover is left like a bird without care, the lover is left like a bird without wings. How will I be awake and aware if the light of the Beloved is absent? Love wills that this Word be brought forth." ,
"And just the moment when you are all confused leaps forth a voice hold me close I'm love and I'm always yours. Both light and shadow are the dance of Love.

"As you start to walk on the way, the way appears." ,
"Though thou pour the ocean into thy pitcher, It can hold no more than one day's store. The pitcher of the desire of the covetous never fills, The oyster-shell fills not with pearls till it is content; Only he whose garment is rent by the violence of love Is wholly pure from covetousness and sin. Hail to thee, then, O LOVE, sweet madness! Thou who healest all our infirmities! Who art the physician of our pride and self-conceit! Who art our Plato and our Galen! Love exalts our earthly bodies to heaven, And makes the very hills to dance with joy!" ,

"Your intelligence is always with you, overseeing your body, even though you may not be aware of its work. If you start doing something against your health, your intelligence will eventually scold you. If it had not been so lovingly close by, and so constantly monitoring, how could it rebuke? You and your body's intelligence are like the beauty and precision of an astrolabe. Together, you calculate how near existence is to the sun. Your intelligence is marvelously intimate. It is not in front of you or behind, or to the left or the right. Now, my friend, try to describe how near is the creator of your intelligence." ,
"saw my sweetheart wandering about the house; he had taken a rebec and was playing a melody. With a plectrum like fire he was playing a sweet melody, drunken and dissolute and charming from the Magian wine. He was invoking the saqi in the air of Iraq2 ; the wine was his object, the saqi was his excuse. The moonfaced saqi pitcher in his hand, entered from a corner and set it in the middle. He filled the first cup with that flaming wine; did you ever see water sending out flames? He set it on his hand for the sake of the lovers, then prostrated and kissed the threshold. My sweetheart seized it from him and quaffed the wine; flames from that wine went running over his face. He was beholding his own beauty, and saying to the evil eye, \"Never has there been, nor shall there come in this age, another like me." ,
"This is how it is to come near you A wave of light builds in the black pupil of the eye. The old become young. The opening lines of the Qur'an open still more. Inside every human chest there is a hand, but it has nothing to write with. Love moves further in, where language turns to fresh cream on the tongue. Every accident, and the essence of every being, is a bud, a blanket tucked into a cradle, a closed mouth. All these buds will blossom, and in that moment you will know what your grief was, and how the seed you planted has been miraculously, and naturally, growing. Now silence. Let soul speak inside spoken things." ,
"Last Night My Soul Cried O Exalted Sphere Of Heaven Last night my soul cried, \"O exalted sphere of Heaven, you hang indeed inverted, with flames in your belly. \"Without sin and crime, eternally revolving upon your body in its complaining is the indigo of mourning; \"Now happy, now unhappy, like Abraham in the fire; at once king and beggar like Ebrahim-e Adham. \"In your form you are terrifying, yet your state is full of anguish: you turn round like a millstone and writhe like a snake.\" Heaven the blessed replied, \"How should I not fear that one who makes the Paradise of the world as Hell? \"In his hand earth is as wax, he makes it Zangi and , he makes it falcon and owl, he makes it sugar and poison. \"He is hidden, friend, and has set us forth thus patent so that he may become concealed. \"How should the ocean of the world be concealed under straws? The straws have been set adancing, the waves tumbling up and down' \"Your body is like the land floating on the waters of the soul; your soul is veiled in the body alike in wedding feast or sorrow. \"In the veil you are a new bride, hot-tempered and obstinate; he is railing sweetly at the good and the bad of the world. \"Through him the earth is a green meadow, the heavens are unresting; on every side through him a fortunate one pardoned and preserved. \"Reason a seeker of certainty through him, patience a seeker of help through him, love seeing the unseen through him, earth taking the form of Adam through him. \"Air seeking and searching, water hand-washing, we Messiah-like speaking, earth Mary-like silent. \"Behold the sea with its billows circling round the earthy ship; behold Kaabas and Meccas at the bottom of this well of Zamzam!\" The king says, \"Be silent, do not cast yourself into the well, for you do not know how to make a bucket and a rope out of my withered stumps." ,

"The fault is in the one who blames. Spirit sees nothing to criticize." ,
"Reason is powerless in the expression of Love." ,
"Love isn't the work of the tender and the gentle; Love is the work of wrestlers. The one who becomes a servant of lovers is really a fortunate sovereign. Don't ask anyone about Love; ask Love about Love. Love is a cloud that scatters pearls." ,
"With what work at you occupied, and for what purpose are you purchased? What sort of bird are you, and with what digestive are you eaten? Pass up this shop of hagglers and seek the shop of Abundance where God is the purchaser [Quran 9:111]. There Compassion has bought the shabby goods no one else would look at. With that Purchaser no base coin is rejected, for making a profit is not the point. Masnavi 6.1264 - 1267" ,

"Love is the instrument to unfold divine secrets... Love is the reign timeless, dimensionless... Lover is as distinct as the moon shining among stars on the sky. Beloved is the sparkle in the heart of the Love." ,
"A life without love is of no account. Don't ask yourself what kind of love you should seek, spiritual or material, divine or mundane, Eastern or Western. Divisions only lead to more divisions. Love has no labels, no definitions. It is what it is, pure and simple. Love is the water of life. And a lover is a soul of fire! The universe turns differently when fire loves water." ,

"The Reed Flute\'s Song Listen to the story told by the reed, of being separated. \"Since I was cut from the reedbed, I have made this crying sound. Anyone apart from someone he loves understands what I say. Anyone pulled from a source longs to go back. At any gathering I am there, mingling in the laughing and grieving, a friend to each, but few will hear the secrets hidden within the notes. No ears for that. Body flowing out of spirit, spirit up from body: no concealing that mixing. But it\'s not given us to see the soul. The reed flute is fire, not wind. Be that empty.\" Hear the love fire tangled in the reed notes, as bewilderment melts into wine. The reed is a friend to all who want the fabric torn and drawn away. The reed is hurt and salve combining. Intimacy and longing for intimacy, one song. A disastrous surrender and a fine love, together. The one who secretly hears this is senseless. A tongue has one customer, the ear. A sugarcane flute has such effect because it was able to make sugar in the reedbed. The sound it makes is for everyone. Days full of wanting, let them go by without worrying that they do. Stay where you are inside such a pure, hollow note. Every thirst gets satisfied except that of these fish, the mystics, who swim a vast ocean of grace still somehow longing for it! No one lives in that without being nourished every day. But if someone doesn\'t want to hear the song of the reed flute, it\'s best to cut conversation short, say good-bye, and leave." ,

"Like This If anyone asks you how the perfect satisfaction of all our sexual wanting will look, lift your face and say, Like this. When someone mentions the gracefulness of the nightsky, climb up on the roof and dance and say, Like this. If anyone wants to know what \"spirit\" is, or what \"God's fragrance\" means, lean your head toward him or her. Keep your face there close. Like this. When someone quotes the old poetic image about clouds gradually uncovering the moon, slowly loosen knot by knot the strings of your robe. Like this. If anyone wonders how Jesus raised the dead, don't try to explain the miracle. Kiss me on the lips. Like this. Like this. When someone asks what it means to \"die for love,\" point here. If someone asks how tall I am, frown and measure with your fingers the space between the creases on your forehead. This tall. The soul sometimes leaves the body, the returns. When someone doesn't believe that, walk back into my house. Like this. When lovers moan, they're telling our story. Like this. I am a sky where spirits live. Stare into this deepening blue, while the breeze says a secret. Like this. When someone asks what there is to do, light the candle in his hand. Like this. How did Joseph's scent come to Jacob? Huuuuu. How did Jacob's sight return? Huuuu. A little wind cleans the eyes. Like this. When Shams comes back from Tabriz, he'll put just his head around the edge of the door to surprise us Like this.",

"Free will exists so free will can be given up freely. Such a person feels no genuine delight if he or she is not drained empty.

"There came one and knocked at the door of the Beloved. And a voice answered and said, 'Who is there?' The lover replied, 'It is I.'

"Wear gratitude like a cloak and it will feed every corner of your life." ,
"Sometimes I Do In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems. You dance inside my chest, where no one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that light becomes this art." ,
"Both light and shadow are the dance of Love. Love has no cause, it is the astrolabe of God's secrets. Lover and loving are inseparable and timeless. Although I may try to describe love, when I experience it, I am speechless. Although I may try to write about love, I am rendered helpless. My pen breaks, and the paper slips away at the ineffable place where lover loving and loved are one. Every moment is made glorious by the light of Love." ,
"Life's waters flow from darkness, Search the darkness, don't run from it." ,
"I am your lover, come to my side, I will open the gate to your love. Come settle with me, let us be neighbors to the stars. You have been hiding so long, endlessly drifting in the sea of my love. Even so, you have always been connected to me. Concealed, revealed, in the unknown, in the un-manifest. I am life itself. You have been a prisoner of a little pond, I am the ocean and its turbulent flood. Come merge with me, leave this world of ignorance. Be with me, I will open the gate to your love." ,
"WARRIOR LIGHT Jafar, Muhammad's cousin, was a warrior of concentrated light. When he rode up to a walled city, it was no more to him than a gulp of water in his dry mouth. This happened at Mutah. No one went out to fight him. \"What\'s to be done?\" the king asked his clairvoyant minister. \"If you strap on your sword with this one,\" replied the advisor, \"also wrap your shroud around you!\" \"But he's only one man!\" \"Ignore the singularity. Look with your wisdom. He gathers multitudes, as stars dissolve in sunlight.\" Human beings can embody a collective, a majesty of spirit, which is not like having a name or a body. A herd of onagers may display a thousand antler points; then a lion comes to the edge of their field: they scatter." ,
"Respond to every call that excites your spirit." ,
"Suffering is a gift. In it is hidden mercy." ,
"Choose to love the one who does not die" ,
"Soul receives from soul that knowledge, therefore not by book nor from tongue. If knowledge of mysteries come after emptiness of mind, that is illumination of heart." ,
"When you have indulged a lust, your wing drops off; you become lame, abandoned by a fantasy.People fancy they are enjoying themselves, but they are really tearing out their wings for the sake of an illusion." ,
"I was a thorn rushing to be with a rose, vinegar blending with honey. Then I found some dirt to make an ointment that would honor my soul. Love says, \"You are right, but don not claim these changes. Remember, I am wind. You are an ember I ignite." ,
"Love Has Nothing To Do With The Five Senses Love has nothing to do with the five senses and the six directions: its goal is only to experience the attraction exerted by the Beloved. Afterwards, perhaps, permission will come from God: the secrets that ought to be told will be told with an eloquence nearer to the understanding of these subtle confusing allusions. The secret is partner with none but the knower of the secret: in the skeptic's ear the secret is no secret at all." ,
"The angel is free because of his knowledge, the beast because of his ignorance. Between the two remains the son of man to struggle." ,
"This is how I would die into the love I have for you: As pieces of cloud dissolve in sunlight." ,
"The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you. Don't go back to sleep." ,
"THE AWAKENING In the early dawn of happiness you gave me three kisses so that I would wake up to this moment of love I tried to remember in my heart what I'd dreamt about during the night before I became aware of this moving of life I found my dreams but the moon took me away It lifted me up to the firmament and suspended me there I saw how my heart had fallen on your path singing a song Between my love and my heart things were happening which slowly slowly made me recall everything You amuse me with your touch although I can't see your hands. You have kissed me with tenderness although I haven't seen your lips You are hidden from me. But it is you who keeps me alive Perhaps the time will come when you will tire of kisses I shall be happy even for insults from you I only ask that you keep some attention on me" ,
"Turn back from the outer. Set your eyes within." ,
"There is a loneliness more precious than life. There is a freedom more precious than the world. Infinitely more precious than life and the world is that moment when one is alone with God." ,
"Your First Eyes A lover has four streams inside, of water, wine, honey, and milk. Find those in yourself, and pay no attention what so-and-so says about such-and-such. The rose does not care if someone calls it a thorn, or a jasmine. Ordinary eyes categorize human beings, That one is a Zoroastrian. This one, Muslim. Walk instead with the other vision given you, your first eyes. Don't squint, and don't stare blankly like a vulture. Those who love fire fall in the fire. A fly slips from the edge into the whey. If you are in love with the infinite, why grieve over earth washing away in the rain? Bow to the essence in a human being. A desert drinks war-blood, but if it knew this secret, springs would rise, rose gardens. Don't be content with judging people good and bad. Grow out of that. The great blessing is that Shams has poured a strength into the ground that lets us wait and trust the waiting." ,
"So the candle flickers and goes out. We have a piece of flint, and a spark. This singing art is sea foam. The graceful movements come from a pearl somewhere on the ocean floor. Poems reach up like spin drift and the edge of driftwood along the beach, wanting! They derive from a slow and powerful root that we can't see. Stop the words now. Open the window in the center of your chest, and let the spirits fly in and out." ,
"What in your life is calling you, When all the noise is silenced, The meetings adjourned... The lists laid aside, And the Wild Iris blooms By itself In the dark forest... What still pulls on your soul?" ,
"THE SHIP SUNK IN LOVE Should Love's heart rejoice unless I burn? For my heart is Love's dwelling. If You will burn Your house, burn it, Love! Who will say, 'It's not allowed'? Burn this house thoroughly! The lover's house improves with fire. From now on I will make burning my aim, From now on I will make burning my aim, for I am like the candle: burning only makes me brighter. Abandon sleep tonight; traverse fro one night the region of the sleepless. Look upon these lovers who have become distraught and like moths have died in union with the One Beloved. Look upon this ship of God's creatures and see how it is sunk in Love." ,
"You have been walking the ocean's edge, holding up your robes to keep them dry. You must dive naked under and deeper under, a thousand times deeper. Love flows down. The ground submits to the sky and suffers what comes. Tell me, is the earth worse for giving in like that? Do not put blankets over the drum. Open completely." ,
"Tear off the mask. Your face is glorious." ,
"Your depression is connected to your insolence and refusal to praise. Whoever feels himself walking on the path, and refuses to praise--that man or woman steals from others every day--is a shoplifter! The sun became full of light when it got hold of itself. Angels only began shining when they achieved discipline. The sun goes out whenever the cloud of not-praising comes. The moment the foolish angel felt insolent, he heard the door close." ,
"Love is a boundless ocean in which heavens are but foam." ,
"The world is a mountain. Whatever you say, it will echo it back to you. Don't say, \"I sang nicely and the mountain echoed an ugly voice!\" That is not possible. The human intellect is a place where hesitation and uncertainty take root. There is no way to overcome this hesitation except by falling in love." ,
"For without you, I swear, the town Has become like a prison to me. Distraction and the mountain And the desert, all I desire." ,
"Here is a relationship booster that is guaranteed to work: Every time your spouse or lover says something stupid make your eyes light up as if you just heard something brilliant." ,
"Yesterday I was clever and tried to change the world. Today I am wise and try to change myself." ,
"Your boundaries are your quest." ,
"A Given The drum we hear inside us now we may not hear tomorrow. We have such fear of what comes next. Death. These loves are like pieces of cotton. Throw them in the fire. Death will be a meeting like that flaring up, a presence you have always wanted to be with. This body and this universe keep us from being free. Those of you decorating your cells so beautifully, do you think they won't be torn down? The eventual demolishing of prisons is a given. Fire-change, disaster-change, you can trust that those will come around to you." ,
"There's a field somewhere beyond all doubt and wrong doing. I'll meet you there." ,
"Peaceful is the one who's not concerned with having more or less. Unbound by name and fame, he is free from sorrow from the world and mostly from himself." ,
"Treasure is stored in the ruined places. Do not break the hearts of the poor and heartbroken people" ,
"When my Beloved appears, With what eye do I see Him? With His eye, not with mine, For none sees Him except Himself." ,
"In silence there is eloquence. Stop weaving and watch how the pattern improves." ,
"You suppose you are the trouble But you are the cure You suppose that you are the lock on the door But you are the key that opens it It's too bad that you want to be someone else You don't see your own face, your own beauty Yet, no face is more beautiful than yours." ,
"Only from the heart Can you touch the sky." ,
"People of the world don't look at themselves, and so they blame one another." ,
"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it." ,
"Everyone sees the unseen in proportion to the clarity of his heart, and that depends upon how much he has polished it. Whoever has polished it more sees more - more unseen forms become manifest to him." ,
"Your body is woven from the light of heaven. Are you aware that its purity and swiftness is the envy of angels and its courage keeps even devils away." ,
"Love is neither a tale nor a game. Love is such a powerful torrent that no one can stand in front of it. Love is the flame which, when it blazes, consumes everything other than the Beloved" ,
"Of the book of God Thou art a copying, A mirror, wherein showed The beauty of the King. All God ever wrought Dwelleth not apart; All thou hast ever sought, Find it in thy heart." ,
"You are my shams." ,
"Each moment from all sides rushes to us the call to love. We are running to contemplate its vast green field. Do you want to come with us?" ,
"Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes. Because for those who love with heart and soul there is no such thing as separation." ,
"Dear soul, if you were not friends with the vast nothing inside, why would you always be casting your net into it, and waiting so patiently?" ,
"No matter how I see myself, I'm nothing.... Anything I am entirely is You!" ,
"What can I do, Dear Ones ? I do not know myself. I am neither Christian nor Jew, neither Magian nor Muslim, I am not from east or west, not from land or sea, not from the shafts of nature nor from the spheres of the firmament, not of the earth, not of water, not of air, not of fire. I am not from the highest heaven, not from this world, not from existence, not from being. I am not from India, not from China, not from Bulgar, not from Saqsin, not from the realm of the two Iraqs, not from the land of Khurasan. I am not from the world, not from beyond, not from heaven and not from hell. I am not from Adam, not from Eve, not from paradise and not from Ridwan. My place is placeless, my trace is traceless, no body, no soul, I am from the soul of souls. I have chased out duality, lived the two worlds as one. One I seek, one I know, one I see, one I call. He is the first, he is the last, he is the outer, he is the inner. Beyond He and He is I know no other. I am drunk from the cup of love, the two worlds have escaped me. I have no concern but carouse and rapture. If one day in my life I spend a moment without you from that hour and that time I would repent my life. If one day I am given a moment in solitude with you I will trample the two worlds underfoot and dance forever. O Beloved , I am so tipsy here in this world, I have no tale to tell but tipsiness and rapture." ,
"Who looks out with my eyes? What is the soul? I cannot stop asking. If I could taste one sip of an answer, I could break out of this prison for drunks. I didn't come here of my own accord, and I can't leave that way. Whoever brought me here will have to take me home." ,
"Be silent, Only the Hand of God Can remove The burdens of your heart." ,
"Butchers enjoy the mindless chewing of lambs. Likewise the appetites work for a shadow king. Do the soul work instead. Feed daily on wisdom. Expand your heart. Rest the appetites. They are bandits on the road. They stop your spirit and steal valuables. The most vital thing about you is your soul intelligence. The rest is a mask for that. Don't lose touch with it. Sensual wantings sometimes block and blur that intelligence as surely as wine or hashish can. Arrogance too is drunken, making you think things true that aren't." ,
"Let the beauty of what you love be what you do." ,
"Love comes with a knife, not some shy question, and not with fears for its reputation!" ,
"Knock, And He'll open the door Vanish, And He'll make you shine like the sun Fall, And He'll raise you to the heavens Become nothing, And He'll turn you into everything." ,
"To the mind there is such a thing as news, whereas to inner knowing, it's all in the middle of its happening. To doubters, this is a pain. To believers, it's gospel. To the lover and the visionary, it's life as it's being lived." ,
"Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will never lead you astray." ,
"There is nothing I want but your presence. In friendship, time dissolves. Life is a cup. This connection is pure wine. What else are cups for? I used to have twenty thousand different desires." ,
"Something opens our wings. Something makes boredom and hurt disappear. Someone fills the cup in front of us: We taste only sacredness." ,
"With life as short as a half taken breath, don't plant anything but love." ,
"A Thirsty Fish I don't get tired of you. Don't grow weary of being compassionate toward me! All this thirst equipment must surely be tired of me, the waterjar, the water carrier. I have a thirsty fish in me that can never find enough of what it's thirsty for! Show me the way to the ocean! Break these half-measures, these small containers. All this fantasy and grief. Let my house be drowned in the wave that rose last night in the courtyard hidden in the center of my chest. Joseph fell like the moon into my well. The harvest I expected was washed away. But no matter. A fire has risen above my tombstone hat. I don't want learning, or dignity, or respectability. I want this music and this dawn and the warmth of your cheek against mine. The grief-armies assemble, but I'm not going with them. This is how it always is when I finish a poem. A great silence comes over me, and I wonder why I ever thought to use language." ,
"Now I remember the story. A True Man stares at his old shoes and sheepskin jacket. Every day he goes up to his attic to look at his work-shoes and worn-out coat. This is his wisdom, to remember the original clay and not get drunk with ego and arrogance. To visit those shoes and jacket is praise. The Absolute works with nothing. The workshop, the materials are what does not exist. Try and be a sheet of paper with nothing on it. Be a spot of ground where nothing is growing, where something might be planted, a seed, possibly, from the Absolute." ,
"Here is a story of a young prince who suddenly sees that the ambitious world is a big game of king of the mountain, a boy scrambling up a pile of sand to call out, \"I am king\"; then another throws him off to make his momentary claim, then another and so on." ,
"Ogni rosa pregna d'interno profumo, narra, quella rosa, i segreti del Tutto." ,
"Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder." ,
"Someone who does not run toward the allure of love walks a road where nothing lives. But this dove here senses the love hawk floating above, and waits, and will not be driven or scared to safety." ,
"When the light returns to its source, it takes nothing of what it has illuminated." ,
"was dead i came alive i was tears i became laughter all because of love when it arrived my temporal life from then on changed to eternal" ,
"Shine like the whole universe is yours." ,
"The Ego is a veil between humans and God'." ,
"Body is not veiled from soul, neither soul from body, Yet no man hath ever seen a soul." , 
"THIS WORLD WHICH IS MADE OF OUR LOVE FOR EMPTINESS Praise to the emptiness that blanks out existence. Existence: this place made from our love for that emptiness! Yet somehow comes emptiness, this existence goes. Praise to that happening, over and over! For years I pulled my own existence out of emptiness. Then one swoop, one swing of the arm, that work is over. Free of who I was, free of presence, free of dangerous fear, hope, free of mountainous wanting. The here-and-now mountain is a tiny piece of a piece of straw blown off into emptiness. These words I'm saying so much begin to lose meaning: existence, emptiness, mountain, straw: words and what they try to say swept out the window, down the slant of the roof." ,
"What the sayer of praise is really praising is himself, by saying implicitly, My eyes are clear.\" Likewise, someone who criticizes is criticizing himself, saying implicitly, \"I can\'t see very well with my eyes so inflamed." ,
"O heart! What a blessing to have reached The circle of Lovers." ,
"TWENTY SMALL GRAVES There was a woman who bore a child almost every year, but the children never lived longer than six months. Usually after three or four months they would die. She grieved long and publicly. \"I take on the work of pregnancy for nine months, but the joy vanishes quicker than a rainbow.\" Twenty children went like that, in fevers to their small graves. One night she had a revelation. She saw the place of unconditional love, call it the garden or source of gardens. The physical eye cannot see its unseeable light. Lamp, green flower, these are just comparisons, so that some of the love-bewildered may catch a fragrance. The woman saw pure grace and, drunk with the seeing, fell to the ground. Those who have the vision said then, \"This morning meal is for those who rise with sincere devotion. The tragedies you\'ve had came from other times when you did not take refuge.\" \"Lord, give me more grief. Tear me to pieces, if it leads here.\" She said this and walked into the presence she had seen. Her children were all there, \"Lost to me,\" she cried, \"but not to you.\" Without this great grieving no one can enter the spirit." ,
"In Silence there is eloquence. Stop weaving and see how the pattern improves." ,
"The cloud weeps, and then the garden sprouts. The baby cries, and the mother's milk flows. The nurse of creation has said, Let them cry a lot. This rain-weeping and sun-burning twine together to make us grow. Keep your intelligence white-hot and your grief glistening, so your life will stay fresh. Cry easily like a little child. Let body needs dwindle and soul decisions increase. Diminish what you give your physical self. Your spiritual eye will begin to open. When the body empties and stays empty, God fills it with musk and mother-of-pearl. That way a man gives his dung and gets purity. Listen to the prophets, not to some adolescent boy. The foundation and the walls of spiritual life are made of self-denials and disciplines. Stay with friends who support you in these. Talk with them about sacred texts, and how you're doing, and how they're doing, and keep your practices together." ,
"The moon stays bright when it doesn't avoid the night." ,
"Though Destiny a hundred times waylays you,in the end it pitches a tent for you in Heaven. It is God's loving kindness to terrify you,in order to lead you to His Kingdom of safety. " ,
"If in thirst you drink water from a cup, you see God in it. Those who are not in love with God will see only their own faces in it." ,
"The pathless path opens whenever you genuinely say, There is no reality but God. There is only God." ,
"Your task is not to seek for love but merely to seek & find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it." ,
"I like to hope that's poems, even in translation, carry the essence of the transforming friendship of Rumi and Shams, that the sun can reappear, whole and radiant in any one of us at any moment." ,
"If there were no way into God, I would not have lain in the grave of this body so long." ,
"Come out of the circle of time And into the circle of love." ,
"Der Bettler ruft, um seine Not zu stillen, Der Fromme ruft um seiner Seele willen." ,
"Learn the alchemy true human beings know. The moment you accept what troubles you've been given the door with open." ,
"If you are irritated by every rub, how will your mirror be polished??" ,
"With love you don't bargain. There, the choice is not yours. Love is a mirror, it reflects only your essence, if you have the courage to look in its face." ,
"Dancing is not just getting up painlessly, like a leaf blown on the wind; dancing is when you tear your heart out and rise out of your body to hang suspended between the worlds." ,
"The minute I heard my first love story I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along." ,
"God calls himself \"Baseer\" [Observant], so that the knowledge that He is watching you may keep you from sinning." ,
"My love, you are closer to me than myself... You shine through my eyes, Your light is brighter than the Moon... Step into the garden so all the flowers... Even the tall poplar can kneel before your beauty... Let your voice silence the lily famous for its hundred tongues, When you want to be kind... You are softer than the soul... But when you withdraw... You can be so cold and harsh. Dear one, you can be wild and rebellious... But when you meet him face to face... His charm will make you docile like the earth, Throw away your shield and bare your chest... There is no stronger protection than him. That's why when the Lover withdraws from the world... He covers all the cracks in the wall... So the outside light cannot come though, He knows that only the inner light illuminates his world!" ,
"Whatever happens. Whatever what is is is what I want. Only that. But that." ,
"I once had a thousand desires. But in my one desire to know you all else melted away." ,
"Try something different. Surrender." ,
"Someone was saying yesterday, \"This world began in time, but eternity will inherit it." ,
"Remember. The way you make love is the way God will be with you." ,
"Study me as much as you like, you will not know me, for I differ in a hundred ways from what you see me to be. Put yourself behind my eyes and see me as I see myself, for I have chosen to dwell in a place you cannot see." ,
"So Recklessly Exposed December and January, gone. Tulips coming up. It's time to watch how trees stagger in the wind and roses never rest. Wisteria and Jasmine twist on themselves. Violet kneels to Hyacinth, who bows. Narcissus winks, wondering what will the lightheaded Willow say of such slow dancing by Cypress. Painters come outdoors with brushes. I love their hands. The birds sing suddenly and all at once. The soul says Ya Hu, quietly. A dove calls, Where, ku? Soul, you will find it. Now the roses show their breasts. No one hides when the Friend arrives. The Rose speaks openly to the Nightingale. Notice how the Green Lily has several tongues but still keeps her secret. Now the Nightingale sings this love that is so recklessly exposed, like you." ,
"The young man could stand it no more. \"What is this? I\'ve been ambushed by a night patrol in full daylight! Your blitherings try to keep me from the presence of a holy man, but I know what light led me here, the same that turned the golden calf into words in a sacred story. A saint is a theater where the qualities of God can be seen. Don't try to keep me out. Puff on this candle, and your face will get burned! Rather try blowing out the sun, or fitting a muzzle on the sea! Old bats like you dream that their cave-dark is everywhere, but it's not." ,
"Protect yourself from your own thoughts." ,
"The real beloved is your beginning and your end. When you find that one, you'll no longer expect anything else" ,
"Body of earth, don't talk of earth Tell the story of pure mirrors The Creator has given you this splendor-- Why talk of anything else?" ,
"Don't make the body do what the spirit does best, and don't put a big load on the spirit that the body could easily carry." ,
"The seeker of truth is a mirror for their neighbors." ,
"Farther And Farther From Zero Suddenly, I fall from the pavilion into a place where I see the ugliness, hypocrisy, rouge on a sunken face, a thorn lodged in a kidney, the blind crone holding a laurel wreath for the winner, her black ribbons in shreds, her eyes dark with purple, a gold anklet on her shriveled leg. The puppet show looks charming, but go behind the screen and watch who runs it. Wash your hands and face of this charade. Anyone who wants these prizes flares up quickly like a wood chip. There is one who can help, who turns the wheel from non-existence to a sweet-breathing emptiness. Words are ways we add up breath, counting stress and syllable with our exacting musical knack that takes us farther and farther from zero." ,
"What can I do, Muslims? I do not know myself. I am neither Christian nor Jew, neither Magian nor Muslim, I am not from east or west, not from land or sea, not from the shafts of nature nor from the spheres of the firmament, not of the earth, not of water, not of air, not of fire.

"Everything you possess of skill, and wealth, and handicraft, wasn't it first merely a thought and a quest?" ,
"To wander in the fields of flowers pull the thorns from your own heart." ,
"Because I Cannot Sleep Because I cannot sleep I make music at night. I am troubled by the one whose face has the color of spring flowers. I have neither sleep nor patience, neither a good reputation nor disgrace. A thousand robes of wisdom are gone. All my good manners have moved a thousand miles away. The heart and the mind are left angry with each other. The stars and the moon are envious of each other. Because of this alienation the physical universe is getting tighter and tighter. The moon says, 'How long will I remain suspended without a sun?' Without Love's jewel inside of me, let the bazaar of my existence be destroyed stone by stone. O Love, You who have been called by a thousand names, You who know how to pour the wine into the chalice of the body, You who give culture to a thousand cultures, You who are faceless but have a thousand faces, O Love, You who shape the faces of Turks, Europeans, and Zanzibaris, give me a glass from Your bottle, or a handful of being from Your Branch. Remove the cork once more. Then we'll see a thousand chiefs prostrate themselves, and a circle of ecstatic troubadours will play. Then the addict will be freed of craving. and will be resurrected, and stand in awe till Judgement Day" ,

"Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion." ,
"Study me as much as you like, you will never know me. For I differ a hundred ways from what you see me to be. Put yourself behind my eyes, and see me as I see myself. Because I have chosen to dwell in a place you can't see." ,
"1 One went to the door of the Beloved and knocked. A voice asked: \"Who is there?\" He answered: \"It is I.\" The voice said: \"There is no room here for me and thee.\" The door was shut. After a year of solitude and deprivation this man returned to the door of the Beloved. He knocked. A voice from within asked: \"Who is there?\" The man said: \"It is Thou.\" The door was opened for him. 2 The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere, they're in each other all along. 3 Love is from the infinite, and will remain until eternity. The seeker of love escapes the chains of birth and death. Tomorrow, when resurrection comes, The heart that is not in love will fail the test. 4 When your chest is free of your limiting ego, Then you will see the ageless Beloved. You can not see yourself without a mirror; Look at the Beloved, He is the brightest mirror. 5 Your love lifts my soul from the body to the sky And you lift me up out of the two worlds. I want your sun to reach my raindrops, So your heat can raise my soul upward like a cloud. 6 There is a candle in the heart of man, waiting to be kindled. In separation from the Friend, there is a cut waiting to be stitched. O, you who are ignorant of endurance and the burning fire of love. Love comes of its own free will, it can't be learned in any school. 7 There are two kinds of intelligence: one acquired, as a child in school memorizes facts and concepts from books and from what the teacher says, collecting information from the traditional sciences as well as from the new sciences. With such intelligence you rise in the world. You get ranked ahead or behind others in regard to your competence in retaining information. You stroll with this intelligence in and out of fields of knowledge, getting always more marks on your preserving tablets. There is another kind of tablet, one already completed and preserved inside you. A spring overflowing its springbox. A freshness in the center of the chest. This other intelligence does not turn yellow or stagnate. It's fluid, and it doesn't move from outside to inside through conduits of plumbing-learning. This second knowing is a fountainhead from within you, moving out." ,
"Osho was very generous with his genius. When I went to Poona in 1988, he answered a question of mine. \"Rumi says, \'I want burning, burning.\' What does this burning have to do with my own possible enlightenment?\" \"You have asked a very dangerous question, Coleman. Burning has nothing to do with your enlightenment. This work you have done with is beautiful. It has to be, because it is coming out of Rumi's love. But for you these poems can become ecstatic self-hypnosis.\" He pretty much nailed me to the floor with that one. Sufism is good, but end up with Zen. It was a fine hit he gave me. I am still drawn to the Sufi longing and love-madness, but clarity is coming up strong on the inside. I have not assimilated his wisdom yet, but I mean to. I am very grateful to him. But it is not wisdom for everyone. Osho crafted his words to suit the individual. Ecstatic self-hypnosis might be just the thing for someone else. He was showing me a daylight beyond any beloved darkness, an ecstatic sobriety beyond any drunkenness." ,

"Those who don't feel this Love pulling them like a river, those who don't drink dawn like a cup of spring water or take sunset like supper, those who don't want to change, let them sleep. This Love is beyond the study of theology, that old trickery and hypocrisy. If you want to improve your mind that way sleep on. I've given up on my brain. I've torn the cloth to shreds and thrown it away. If you're not completely naked wrap your beautiful robe of words around you, and sleep." ,

"Epilogue to Book I. Alas! the forbidden fruits were eaten, And thereby the warm life of reason was congealed. A grain of wheat eclipsed the sun Of Adam, l Like as the Dragon's tail 2 dulls the brightness of the moon. Behold how delicate is the heart, that a morsel of dust Clouded its moon with foul obscurity! When bread is \"substance,\" to eat it nourishes us; When 'tis empty \"form,\" it profits nothing. Like as the green thorn which is cropped by the camel, And then yields him pleasure and nutriment; When its greenness has gone and it becomes dry, If the camel crops that same thorn in the desert, It wounds his palate and mouth without pity, As if conserve of roses should turn to sharp swords. When bread is \"substance,\" it is as a green thorn; When \'tis \"form,\" \'tis as the dry and coarse thorn. And thou eatest it in the same way as of yore Thou wert wont to eat it, O helpless being, Eatest this dry thing in the same manner, After the real \"substance\" is mingled with dust; It has become mingled with dust, dry in pith and rind. O camel, now beware of that herb! The Word is become foul with mingled earth; The water is become muddy; close the mouth of the well, Till God makes it again pure and sweet; Yea, till He purifies what He has made foul. Patience will accomplish thy desire, not haste. Be patient, God knows what is best." ,

"You have no idea how hard I've looked for a gift to bring You. Nothing seemed right. What's the point of bringing gold to the gold mine, or water to the ocean. Everything I came up with was like taking spices to the Orient. It's no good giving my heart and my soul because you already have these. So I've brought you a mirror. Look at yourself and remember me." ,

"Cradle My Heart Last night, I was lying on the rooftop, thinking of you. I saw a special Star, and summoned her to take you a message. I prostrated myself to the Star and asked her to take my prostration to that Sun of Tabriz so that with his light, he can turn my dark stones into gold. I opened my chest and showed her my scars, I told her to bring me news of my bloodthirsty Lover. As I waited, I paced back and forth, until the child of my heart became quiet. The child slept, as if I were rocking his cradle. Oh Beloved, give milk to the infant of the heart, and don't hold us from our turning. You have cared for hundreds, don't let it stop with me now. At the end, the town of unity is the place for the heart." ,
"Doing as others told me, I was Blind. Coming when others called me, I was Lost. Then I left everyone, myself as well. Then I found Everyone, Myself as well." ,
"When Love comes suddenly and taps on your window, run and let it in but first shut the door of your reason. Even the smallest hint chases love away like smoke that drowns the freshness of the morning breeze. To reason Love can only say, the way is barred, you can't pass through but to the lover it offers a hundred blessings. Before the mind decides to take a step Love has reached the seventh heaven. Before the mind can figure how Love has climbed the Holy Mountain. I must stop this talk now and let Love speak from its nest of silence." ,

"Who Says Words With My Mouth? All day I think about it, then at night I say it. Where did I come from, and what am I supposed to be doing? I have no idea. My soul is from elsewhere, I\'m sure of that, and I intend to end up there. This drunkenness began in some other tavern. When I get back around to that place, I\'ll be completely sober. Meanwhile, I\'m like a bird from another continent, sitting in this aviary. The day is coming when I fly off, but who is it now in my ear who hears my voice? Who says words with my mouth? Who looks out with my eyes? What is the soul? I cannot stop asking. If I could taste one sip of an answer, I could break out of this prison for drunks. I didn\'t come here of my own accord, and I can\'t leave that way. Whoever brought me here will have to take me home. This poetry, I never know what I\'m going to say. I don\'t plan it. When I\'m outside the saying of it, I get very quiet and rarely speak at all." ,

Learn to die in the infinitely elusive moment." ,
"We were green: we ripened and grew golden. The Sea terrified us: we learned how to drown. Squat and earthbound, we unfolded huge wings. We started sober: are love\'s startled drunkards. You hide me in your cloak of nothingness Reflect my ghost in your glass of being I am nothing, yet appear: transparent dream Where your eternity briefly trembles." ,
"Let Go Of Your Worries Let go of your worries and be completely clear-hearted, like the face of a mirror that contains no images. If you want a clear mirror, behold yourself and see the shameless truth, which the mirror reflects. If metal can be polished to a mirror-like finish, what polishing might the mirror of the heart require? Between the mirror and the heart is this single difference: the heart conceals secrets, while the mirror does not." ,
"Work on your strong qualities and become resplendent like the ruby. Practice self-denial and accept difficulty. Always see infinite life in letting the self die. Your stoniness will decrease; your ruby nature will grow. The signs of self-existence will leave your body, and ecstasy will take you over." ,

When I'm outside the saying of it, I get very quiet and rarely speak at all. We have a huge barrel of wine, but no cups. That's fine with us. Every morning We glow and in the evening we glow again." ,

"The morning wind spreads its fresh smell. We must get up and take that in, that wind that lets us live. Breathe before it's gone." ,
"Every war and every conflict between human beings has happened because of some disagreement about names. It is such an unnecessary foolishness, because just beyond the arguing there is a long table of companionship set and waiting for us to sit down. What is praised is one, so the praise is one too, many jugs being poured into a huge basin. All religions, all this singing one song. The differences are just illusion and vanity. Sunlight looks a little different on this wall than it does on that wall and a lot different on this other one, but it is still one light. We have borrowed these clothes, these time-and-space personalities, from a light, and when we praise, we are pouring them back in." ,
"Any state other than what you have experienced seems absurd. You have had certain visions. Before them, did not mysticism sound ridiculous? What you've been given has released you from prison, ten times! And won't this empty desert freedom you feel now someday be confining?" ,

"Have you ever gotten breathless before from a beautiful face, for i see you there, my dear." ,
"Now sleeping, now awake, my hart is in constant fervor. It is a covered saucepan, placed on fire. O you! who have offered us from a cup a silencing wine; Each moment a new tale is shouting to be told in silence. In his wrath there are a hundred kindnesess, in his meanness a hundred generosities; In his ignorance immeasurable gnosis, silently speaking like the mind. The words of those whom you have silenced, cannot hear but those whom you have made unconscious; I am both silent and fermenting for you like the sea of Aden" ,

"Our feast, our wedding Will be auspicious to the world. God fit the feast and wedding To our length like a proper garment. Venus and the moon Will be matched to each other, The parrot with sugar. The most beautifully-faced Beloved Makes a different kind of wedding every night. With the favor of our Sultan's prosperity, Hearts become spacious And men pair up with each other. Troubles and anxieties are all gone. Here tonight, You go again To the wedding and feasting. O beauty who adorned our city, You will be groom to the beauties. How nicely You walk in our neighborhood, Coming to us so beautifully. O our river, O One Who is searching for us, How nicely You flow in our stream. How nicely You flow with our desires, Unfastening the binding of our feet. You make us walk so nicely, holding our hand, O Joseph of our world. Cruelty suits You well. It's a mistake for us to expect Your loyalty. Step as You wish on our bloody Soul. O Soul of my Soul, pull our Souls To our Beloved's temple. Take this piece of bone. Give it as a gift to our Huma*. O wise ones, give thanks To our Sultan's kindness, who adds Souls to Soul, Keep dancing, O considerate ones. Keep whirling and dancing. At the wedding night of rose and Nasrin* I hang the drum on my neck. Tonight, the tambourine and small drum Will become our clothes. Be silent! Venus becomes the Cupbearer tonight And offers glasses to our sweetheart, Whose skin is fair and rosy, Who takes a glass and drinks. For the sake of God, because of our praying, Now Sufis become exuberant At the assembly of God's Absence. They put the belt of zeal on their waists And start Sama'*. One group of people froth like the sea, Prostrating like waves. The other group battles like swords, Drinking the blood of our glasses. Be silent! Tonight, the Sultan Went to the kitchen. He is cooking with joy. But a most unusual thing, Tonight, the Beloved is cooking our Halva" ,

"A Mystic And A Drunk The Universe turns on an axis. Let my soul circle around a table like a beggar, like a planet rolling in the vast, totally helpless and free. The knight and the castle move jaggedly about the chessboard, but they're actually centered on the king. They circle. If love is your center, a ring gets put on your finger. Something inside the moth is made of fire. A mystic touches the annihilating tip of pure nothing. A drunkard thinks peeing is absolution. Lord, take these impurities from me. The lord replies, First, understand the nature of impurity. If your key is bent, the lock will not open. I fall silent. King Shams has come. Always when I close, he opens." ,
"When you are with everyone but me, you're with no one. When you are with no one but me, you're with everyone. Instead of being so bound up with everyone, be everyone. When you become that many, you're nothing. Empty." ,
"Didn't I tell you, Don't run away from me! Didn't I tell you, In this empty fantasy, Even if for centuries, you wander angrily You'll never find another true companion like me." ,
"A lover knows only humility, he has no choice. He steals into your alley at night, he has no choice. He longs to kiss every lock of your hair, don't fret, he has no choice. In his frenzied love for you, he longs to break the chains of his imprisonment, he has no choice." ,
"Do you pay regular visits to yourself? Don't argue or answer rationally. Let us die, and dying, reply." ,
"Are you jealous of the ocean's generosity? Why would you refuse to give this joy to anyone? Fish don't hold the sacred liquid in cups! They swim the huge fluid freedom." ,
"The Ripe Fig Now that You live here in my chest, anywhere we sit is a mountaintop. And those other images, which have enchanted people like porcelain dolls from China, which have made men and women weep for centuries, even those have changed now. What used to be pain is a lovely bench where we can rest under the roses. A left hand has become a right. A dark wall, a window. A cushion in a shoe heel, the leader of the community! Now silence. What we say is poison to some and nourishing to others. What we say is a ripe fig, but not every bird that flies eats figs." ,

"Forget safety. Live where you fear to live." ,
"Shall I tell you our secret? We are charming thieves who steal hearts and never fail because we are the friends of the One. Blessed is the poem that comes through me but not of me because the sound of my own music will drown the song of Love." ,
"Oh you, straying heart, just come! Oh you, aching liver, just come! If the path to the gate is closed, Take the way by the wall, but come!" ,
"When someone beats a rug with a stick, he is not beating the rug : his aim is to get rid of the dust. Your inward is full of dust from the veil of \'I\'ness, and that dust will not leave all at once.

"THE ALCHEMY OF LOVE You come to us from another world From beyond the stars and void of space. Transcendent, Pure, Of unimaginable beauty, Bringing with you the essence of love You transform all who are touched by you. Mundane concerns, troubles, and sorrows dissolve in your presence, Bringing joy to ruler and ruled To peasant and king You bewilder us with your grace. All evils transform into goodness. You are the master alchemist. You light the fire of love in earth and sky in heart and soul of every being. Through your love existence and nonexistence merge. All opposites unite. All that is profane becomes sacred again." ,
"HUSAM There is a way of passing away from the personal, a dying that makes one plural. A gnat lights in buttermilk to become nourishment for many. Your soul is like that, Husam. Hundreds of thousands of impressions from the invisible world are eagerly wanting to come through you! I get dizzy with the abundance. When life is this dear, it means the source is pulling us. Freshness comes from there. We're given the gift of continuously dying and being resurrected, ocean within ocean. The body's death now to me is like going to sleep. No fear of drowning, I'm in another water. Stones don't dissolve in rain. This is the end of the fifth book of the Masnavi. With constellations in the night sky, some look up and point. Others can be guided by the arrangements: the Sagittarian bow piercing enemies, the Water Jar soaking fruit trees, the Bull plowing and sowing its truth, the Lion tearing darkness open to red satin. Use these words to change. Be kind and honest, and harmful poisons will turn sweet inside you." ,
"The flower that does not smile at the branches withers." , 
"Do not be satisfied with the stories that come before you. Unfold your own myth." ,
"Atom, you want to flee the sun? Madman, give up! You're a jar; fate's a stone- kick against it, and you''l waste your wine." ,

"Two there are who are never satisfied: the lover of the world and the lover of knowledge." ,
"The universe and the light of the stars come through me." ,
"HOW ATTRACTION HAPPENS Moses is talking to someone drunk with worshiping the golden calf. \"What happened to your doubt? You used to be so skeptical of me. The Red Sea parted. Food came every day in the wilderness for forty years. A fountain sprang out of a rock. You saw these things and still reject the idea of prophethood. Then the magician Samiri does a trick to make the metal cow low, and immediately you kneel! What did that hollow statue say? Have you heard a dullness like your own?\" This is how attraction happens: people with nothing they value delight in worthlessness. Someone who thinks there's no meaning or purpose feels drawn to images of futility. Each moves to be with its own. The ox does not turn toward a lion. Wolves have no interest in Joseph, unless to devour him. But if a wolf is cured of wolfishness, it will sleep close by Joseph, like a dog in the presence of meditators. Soul companionship gives safety and light to a cave full of friends." ,
"Let go of your mind and then be mindful. Close your ears and listen!" ,

"A Moment Of Happiness: A moment of happiness, you and I sitting on the verandah, apparently two, but one in soul, you and I. We feel the flowing water of life here, you and I, with the garden's beauty and the birds singing. The stars will be watching us, and we will show them what it is to be a thin crescent moon. You and I unselfed, will be together, indifferent to idle speculation, you and I. The parrots of heaven will be cracking sugar as we laugh together, you and I. In one form upon this earth, and in another form in a timeless sweet land." ,
"Three kinds of people are particularly pathetic: the powerful man who is out of power, the rich man with no money, and the learned man laughed at. \" Yet these are those who badly want change! Some dogs sit satisfied in their kennels. But someone who last year drank ecstatic union, the pre-eternity agreement, who this year has a hangover from bad desire wine, the way he cries out for the majesty he's lost, give me his longing!" ,
"A thousand half-loves must be forsaken to take one whole heart home." ,

"We watch a sunlight dust dance, and we try to be that lively, but nobody knows what music those particles hear. Each of us has a secret companion musician to dance to. Unique rhythmic play, a motion in the street we alone know and hear." ,
"I don't want learning, or dignity, or respectability. I want this music, and this dawn, and the warmth of your cheek against mine." ,
"If you catch a glimpse of this brightness, you will set sleep afire: for by night-faring and servitude Venus became the companion of the moon.",

"The world's flattery and hypocrisy is a sweet morsel: eat less of it, for it is full of fire. Its fire is hidden while its taste is manifest, but its smoke becomes visible in the end. " ,
"I wrote Your Name in My Heart and Forever it will Stay." ,
"Say I Am You I am dust particles in sunlight. I am the round sun. To the bits of dust I say, Stay. To the sun, Keep moving. I am morning mist, and the breathing of evening. I am wind in the top of a grove, and surf on the cliff. Mast, rudder, helmsman, and keel, I am also the coral reef they founder on. I am a tree with a trained parrot in its branches. Silence, thought, and voice. The musical air coming through a flute, a spark of a stone, a flickering in metal. Both candle and the moth crazy around it. Rose, and the nightingale lost in the fragrance. I am all orders of being, the circling galaxy, the evolutionary intelligence, the lift, and the falling away. What is, and what isn't. You who know Jelaluddin, You the one in all, say who I am. Say I am You." ,
"We are the mirror, as well as the face in it. We are tasting the taste of eternity this minute. We are pain and what cures pain. We are the sweet cold water and the jar that pours. Soul of the world, no life, nor world remain, no beautiful women and men longing. Only this ancient love circling the holy black stone of nothing. Where the lover is the loved, the horizon and everything within it." ,
"I see my beauty in you." ,
"The only lasting beauty is the beauty of the heart" ,

"Be quiet now and wait. It may be that the ocean one, the one we desire so to move into and become, desires us out here on land a little longer, going our sundry roads to the shore." ,
"I break out laughing. I frown. I yell and scream. Sometimes, if one jokes and giggles, one causes war. So I hide how tickled I am. Tears well up in my eyes. My body is a large city. Much grieving in one sector. I live in another part. Lakewater. Something on fire over here. I am sour when you are sour, sweet when you are sweet. You are my face and my back. Only through you can I know this back-scratching pleasure. Now people the likes of you and I come clapping, inventing dances, climbing into this high meadow. I am a spoiled parrot who eats only candy. I have no interest in bitter food. Some have been given harsh knowledge. Not I. Some are lame and jerking along. I am smooth and glidingly quick. Their road is full of washed-out places and long inclines. Mine is royally level, effortless. The huge Jerusalem mosque stands inside me, and women full of light. Laughter leaps out. It is the nature of the rose to laugh. It cannot help but laugh." ,
"When the Queen of Sheba thought to honor Solomon, she loaded forty mules with gold bricks, but when her caravan reached the wide plain leading to Solomon's palace, they noticed that the top layer of the plateau was pure gold! For forty days they journeyed on gold. What foolishness to take gold bars to Solomon when the very dirt there is gold! You that think to offer your intelligence to God, reconsider. Intelligence on the way is less than road dust. The embarrassing commonness of what they bring slows them down. They argue. They discuss turning back, but they continue, carrying out the orders of their queen. Solomon laughs when he sees them unloading. \"When have I asked you for a sop for my soup? I do not want gifts from you. I want you ready for the gifts I give. You worship a planet that creates gold. Worship instead the one who creates universes. You worship the sun, which is only a cook. Think of a solar eclipse. What if you get attacked at midnight? Who will help you then?" ,
"Shadows can indicate what\'s shining bright But it\'s the sun which fills your soul with light," ,
"CUP AND OCEAN These forms we seem to be are cups floating in an ocean of living consciousness. They fill and sink without leaving an arc of bubbles or any good-bye spray. What we are is that ocean, too near to see, though we swim in it and drink it in. Don't be a cup with a dry rim, or someone who rides all night and never knows the horse beneath his thighs, the surging that carries him along." ,
"Out beyond ideas of rightdoing and wrongdoing there is a field. I'll meet you there." ,
"My soul is from elsewhere, I'm sure of that, and I intend to end up there." ,
"Joseph dreamed the sun and moon were bowing down to worship him. Ten years went by and that came to pass. The saying, 'He sees by God's light,' is not an idle idiom. It means something. There is light that can shatter this earth-and-sky. It cannot be seen with eyes. This vision sees only the next step, what's directly in front." ,
"But listen to me: for one moment, quit being sad. Hear blessings dropping their blossoms around you. God." ,
"The ground's generosity takes in our compost and grows beauty! Try to be more like the ground." ,

"The eye of the intellect is drunk with You, the wheeling galaxy is humble before You, the ear of ecstasy is in Your hand; nothing happens without You. The soul is bubbling with You, the heart imbibes from You, the intellect bellows in rapture; nothing happens without You." ,
"Listen, O drop, give yourself up without regret, and in exchange gain the Ocean. Listen, O drop, bestow upon yourself this honor, and in the arms of the Sea be secure. Who indeed should be so fortunate? An Ocean wooing a drop! In God's name, in God's name, sell and buy at once! Give a drop, and take this Sea full of pearls." ,
"Everything in the universe is a pitcher brimming with wisdom and beauty." ,
"Live life as if everything is rigged in your favor." ,
"I am smiling at myself today There's no wish left in this heart Or perhaps there is no heart left Free from all desire I sit quietly like Earth My silent cry echoes like thunder Throughout the universe I am not worried about it I know it will be heard by no one Except me." ,
"OH HAPPY DAY when in you presence, my ruler, I shall die! When near the sugar-treasure melting like sugar I shall die! Out of my dust will grow a thousand of centrifolias When in the shade of yonder cypress in gardens I shall die. And when you pour into my goblet the bitter drink of death, I'll kiss the goblet full of joy, dear, and drunken I shall die. I may turn yellow like the autumn when people speak of death, Thanks to your smiling lip: like springtime and smiling shall I die. I have died many times, but your breath made me alive again, Should I die thus a hundred more times I happily shall die! A child that dies in mother's bosom, that's how I am, my friend, For in the bosom of His Mercy and kindness, I shall die. Say: Where would death be for the lovers? Impossible is that! For in the fountain of the Water of Life - there I shall die!" ,
"Love is the house of God and you are living in that house." ,
"For ages you have come and gone courting this delusion. For ages you have run from the pain and forfeited the ecstasy. So come, return to the root of the root of your own soul. Although you appear in earthly form Your essence is pure Consciousness. You are the fearless guardian of Divine Light. So come, return to the root of the root of your own soul. When you lose all sense of self the bonds of a thousand chains will vanish. Lose yourself completely, Return to the root of the root of your own soul. You descended from Adam, by the pure Word of God, but you turned your sight to the empty show of this world. Alas, how can you be satisfied with so little? So come, return to the root of the root of your own soul. Why are you so enchanted by this world when a mine of gold lies within you? Open your eyes and come --- Return to the root of the root of your own soul. You were born from the rays of God's Majesty when the stars were in their perfect place. How long will you suffer from the blows of a nonexistent hand? So come, return to the root of the root of your own soul. You are a ruby encased in granite. How long will you decieve Us with this outer show? O friend, We can see the truth in your eyes! So come, return to the root of the root of your own soul. After one moment with that glorious Friend you became loving, radiant, and ecstatic. Your eyes were sweet and full of fire. Come, return to the root of the root of your own soul. Shams-e Tabriz, the King of the Tavern has handed you an eternal cup, And God in all His glory is pouring the wine. So come! Drink! Return to the root of the root of your own soul. Soul of all souls, life of all life - you are That. Seen and unseen, moving and unmoving - you are That. The road that leads to the City is endless; Go without head and feet and you'll already be there. What else could you be? - you are That." ,
"Oh Beloved, take me. Liberate my soul. Fill me with your love and release me from the two worlds. If I set my heart on anything but you let fire burn me from inside. Oh Beloved, take away what I want. Take away what I do. Take away what I need. Take away everything that takes me from you" ,
"Be empty of worrying. Think of who created thought! Why do you stay in prison When the door is so wide open?" ,
"silence is the language of god, all else is poor translation." ,
"Love Dogs One night a man was crying, Allah! Allah! His lips grew sweet with the praising, until a cynic said, \"So! I have heard you calling out, but have you ever gotten any response?\" The man had no answer to that. He quit praying and fell into a confused sleep. He dreamed he saw Khidr, the guide of souls, in a thick, green foliage. \"Why did you stop praising?\" \"Because I\'ve never heard anything back.\" \"This longing you express is the return message.\" The grief you cry out from draws you toward union. Your pure sadness that wants help is the secret cup. Listen to the moan of a dog for its master. That whining is the connection. There are love dogs no one knows the names of. Give your life to be one of them." ,
"Conventional opinion is the ruin of our souls." ,
"If you are irritated by every rub, how will your mirror be polished?" ,
"WOODEN CAGES I may be clapping my hands, but I don't belong to a crowd of clappers. Neither this nor that, I'm not part of a group that loves flute music or one that loves gambling or drinking wine. Those who live in time, descended from Adam, made of earth and water, I'm not part of that. Don't listen to what I say, as though these words came from an inside and went to an outside. Your faces are very beautiful, but they are wooden cages. You had better run from me. My words are fire. I have nothing to do with being famous, or making grand judgments, or feeling full of shame. I borrow nothing. I don't want anything from anybody. I flow through human beings. Love is my only companion. When union happens, my speech goes inside toward Shams. At that meeting all the secrets of language will no longer be secret." ,

"If I hold you in my heart, you'll wither; Become a thorn if I hold you in my eyes. No, I'll make a place for you within my soul instead So you'll be my love in lives beyond this life." ,
"Sorrow prepares you for joy. It violently sweeps everything out of your house, so that new joy can find space to enter. It shakes the yellow leaves from the bought of your heart, so that fresth, green leaves can grow in their place. It pulls up the rotten roots, so that new roots hidden beneath have room to grow. Whatever sorrow shakes from your heart, far better things will take their place." ,
"Oh you, unceasing sun, to me Your particles communicate The luminous essence of God, Are you our God? I do not know. Intoxicated, I say nought, Bewitched by the magic potion. I cannot differentiate Between my drunk and sober state." ,
"Don't toy with things that block your light." ,
"This We Have Now This we have now is not imagination. This is not grief or joy. Not a judging state, or an elation, or sadness. Those come and go. This is the presence that doesn't. It's dawn, Husam, here in the splendor of coral, inside the Friend, the simple truth of what Hallaj said. What else could human beings want? When grapes turn to wine they're wanting this. When the nightsky pours by, it's really a crowd of beggars, and they all want some of this! This that we are now created the body, cell by cell, like bees building a honeycomb. The human body and the universe grew from this, not this from the universe and the human body." ,
"The looking itself is a trace of what we are looking for. Be quiet now and wait. It may be that the ocean one, the one that we desire so to move into and become, desires us out here on land a little longer, going our sundry roads to the shore." ,
"Your magnificence has made me a wonder. Your charm has taught me the way of love." ,
"Muhammad is tasting continually the wine of the agreement he made with God before the creation of the universe, the wine of the question Am I not your Lord? and of the answer Yes! The seven sleepers sipped that and slept three hundred and nine years. The Egyptian women drank one cup and were lost in Joseph's beauty. Pharaoh's magicians inhaled this fragrance, and the gallows looked like lovers coming toward them. Jafar lost his hands and feet in battle, yet flew because he tasted this Yes. Yes." ,

"Woman is a ray of God. She is not that earthly beloved: she is creative, not created." ,
"Solomon resumes talking to the envoys of Sheba: \"Go back and tell her what you have seen, how the rare substance she thinks we value can be scraped up anywhere as soil. Tell her the elaborate throne she loves looks more like a bandage over a hurt place. We admire Ibrahim, who left his kingdom so quickly. With us, one genuine kneeling down in total humility would buy hundreds of governments. Our currency is an eagerness to accept the gift of soul change. Nothing else. Sheba's sumptuous life is just a hole in the ground with children playing in it, pretending to be kings and prime ministers. We perform reverse alchemy, transmuting gold mines into abandoned sites!" ,
"Light Breeze As regards feeling pain, like a hand cut in battle, consider the body a robe you wear. When you meet someone you love, do you kiss their clothes? Search out who's inside. Union with God is sweeter than body comforts. We have hands and feet different from these. Sometimes in dream we see them. That is not illusion. It's seeing truly. You do have a spirit body; don't dread leaving the physical one. Sometimes someone feels this truth so strongly that he or she can live in mountain solitude totally refreshed. The worried, heroic doings of men and women seem weary and futile to dervishes enjoying the light breeze of spirit." ,
"You are the comfort of my soul in the season of sorrow. You are the wealth of my spirit in the heartbreak of loss." ,
"Pull the thorn of existence out of the heart! Fast! For when you do, you will see thousands of rose gardens in yourself." ,
"Run from what's comfortable. Forget safety. Live where you fear to live. Destroy your reputation. Be notorious. I have tried prudent planning long enough. From now on I'll be mad." ,
"Beyond our ideas of right-doing and wrong-doing, there is a field. I'll meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about. Ideas, language, even the phrase \"each other\" doesn't make sense any more." ,
"Come, seek, for search is the foundation of fortune; every success depends upon focusing the heart" ,
"Listen; there's a hell of a good universe next door: let's go." ,
"But love unexplained is clearer. When pen hasted to write, On reaching the subject of love it split in twain. When the discourse touched on the matter of love, Pen was broken and paper torn. In explaining it Reason sticks fast, as an ass in mire; Naught but Love itself can explain love and lovers! None but the sun can display the sun, If you would see it displayed, turn not away from it. Shadows, indeed, may indicate the sun's presence, But only the sun displays the light of life. Shadows induce slumber, like evening talks, But when the sun arises the \"moon is split asunder.\" 3 In the world there is naught so wondrous as the sun, But the Sun of the soul sets not and has no yesterday. Though the material sun is unique and single, We can conceive similar suns like to it. But the Sun of the soul, beyond this firmament, No like thereof is seen in concrete or abstract.4" , 
"Let me praise you tonight. Because tomorrow you cannot be described by words, While describing you. Tomorrow, earth and sky will disappear altogether." ,

"What are \"I\" and \"You\"? Just lattices In the niches of a lamp Through which the One Light radiates. \"I\" and \"You\" are the veil Between heaven and earth; Lift this veil and you will see How all sects and religions are one. Lift this veil and you will ask When \"I\" and \"You\" do not exist What is mosque? What is synagogue? What is fire temple?" ,
"Like a shadow, I am and I am not." ,
"People who repress desires often turn, suddenly, into hypocrites." ,
"Go back, go back to sleep. Yes, you are allowed. You who have no Love in your heart, you can go back to sleep. The power of Love is exclusive to us, you can go back to sleep. I have been burnt by the fire of Love. You who have no such yearning in your heart, go back to sleep. The path of Love, has seventy-two folds and countless facets. Your love and religion is all about deceit, control and hypocrisy, go back to sleep. I have torn to pieces my robe of speech, and have let go of the desire to converse. You who are not naked yet, you can go back to sleep." , 
"Words are ways we add up breath, counting stress and syllable with our exacting musical knack that takes us farther and farther from zero." , 
"A wealth you cannot imagine flows through you. Do not consider what strangers say. Be secluded in your secret heart-house, that bowl of silence." ,
"Love Are you fleeing from Love because of a single humiliation? What do you know of Love except the name? Love has a hundred forms of pride and disdain, and is gained by a hundred means of persuasion. Since Love is loyal, it purchases one who is loyal: it has no interest in a disloyal companion. The human being resembles a tree; its root is a covenant with God: that root must be cherished with all one's might. A weak covenant is a rotten root, without grace or fruit. Though the boughs and leaves of the date palm are green, greenness brings no benefit if the root is corrupt. If a branch is without green leaves, yet has a good root, a hundred leaves will put forth their hands in the end." ,
"You soak up my soul and mingle me. Each drop of my blood cries out to the earth. We are partners, blended as one." ,
"An intelligent man, or woman, is a lamp that guides itself. Let him or her lead. Trust the knowing they browse. A half-intelligent person is one who lets the intelligent person be guide. He holds on like the blind to the coat of a helper. Through another, he acts and sees and learns. There is a third kind with no intellect at all, who takes no advice, strolls out into the wilderness, runs a little to one side, stops, limps through the night with no candle, no stub of a candle, no notion what to ask for. The first has perfect intellect. The second knows enough to surrender to the first. One breathes with Jesus. The other dies, so Jesus can breathe through him. The third flops and flounders in all directions, with no direction, lurches and leaps, trying everything, with no way or way out." ,
"PRAYER IS AN EGG On Resurrection Day God will say, \"What did you do with the strength and energy your food gave you on earth? How did you use your eyes? What did you make with your five senses while they were dimming and playing out? I gave you hands and feet as tools for preparing the ground for planting. Did you, in the health I gave, do the plowing?\" You will not be able to stand when you hear those questions. You will bend double, and finally acknowledge the glory. God will say, \"Lift your head and answer the questions.\" Your head will rise a little, then slump again. \"Look at me! Tell what you've done.\" You try, but you fall back flat as a snake. \"I want every detail. Say!\" Eventually you will be able to get to a sitting position. \"Be plain and clear. I have given you such gifts. What did you do with them?\"You turn to the right looking to the prophet for help, as though to say, I am stuck in the mud of my life. Help me out of this! They will answer, those kings, \"The time for helping is past. The plow stands there in the field. You should have used it. \"Then you turn to the left, where your family is, and they will say, \"Don't look at us! This conversation is between you and your creator.\" Then you pray the prayer that is the essence of every ritual: God, I have no hope. I am torn to shreds. You are my first and last and only refuge. Don't do daily prayers like a bird pecking, moving its head up and down. Prayer is an egg. Hatch out the total helplessness inside." ,
"I closed my mouth and spoke to you in a hundred silent ways." ,
"My Worst Habit My worst habit is I get so tired of winter I become a torture to those I'm with. If you're not here, nothing grows. I lack clarity. My words tangle and knot up. How to cure bad water? Send it back to the river. How to cure bad habits? Send me back to you. When water gets caught in habitual whirlpools, dig a way out through the bottom to the ocean. There is a secret medicine given only to those who hurt so hard they can't hope. The hopers would feel slighted if they knew. Look as long as you can at the friend you love, no matter whether that friend is moving away from you or coming back toward you. How to cure bad water ? Send it back to the river ! How to cure bad habits ? Send me back to you." ,
"That moon which the sky never saw even in dreams has risen again" ,
"After days of feasting, fast. After days of sleeping, stay awake one night. After these times of bitter storytelling, joking, and serious considerations, we should give ourselves two days between layers of baklava in the quiet seclusion where soul sweetens and thrives more than with language. I hear nothing in my ear but your voice. Heart has plundered mind of its eloquence. Love writes a transparent calligraphy, so on the empty page my soul can read and recollect. Which is worth more, a crowd of thousands, or your own genuine solitude? Freedom, or power over an entire nation? A little while alone in your room will prove more valuable than anything else that could ever be given you., Two days of silence" ,
"I want your sun to reach my raindrops, so your heat can raise my soul upward like a cloud." ,
"Either give me more wine or leave me alone." ,
"THE TASTE A walnut kernel shaken against its shell makes a delicate sound, but the walnut taste and the sweet oil inside makes unstruck music. Mystics call the shell rattling talk, the other, the taste of silence. We've been speaking poetry and opening so-called secrets of soul growth long enough. After days of feasting, fast; after days of sleeping, stay awake one night; after these times of bitter storytelling, joking, and serious considerations, we should give ourselves two days between layers of baklava in the quiet seclusion where soul sweetens and thrives more than with language. ----------------------------------------- I hear nothing in my ear but your voice. Heart has plundered mind of all its eloquence. Love writes a transparent calligraphy, so on the empty page my soul can read and recollect." ,
"This mirror inside me shows. I can't say what, but I can't not know. I run from body. I run from spirit. I do not belong anywhere." ,
"I am your moon and your moonlight too I am your flower garden and your water too I have come all this way, eager for you Without shoes or shawl I want you to laugh To kill all your worries To love you To nourish you." ,
"Don't run around this world looking for a hole to hide in. There are wild beasts in every cave! If you live with mice, the cat claws will find you." ,
"Every moment I shape my destiny with a chisel, I am a carpenter of my own soul." ,
"Heartsick, heartbroken: To know love is to know pain. What could be more common? Even so, each broken heart is so singular That with it we probe the divine." ,
"And patience flees my heart, And reason flees my mind. Oh, how drunk can I get to be, Without your love's security?" ,
"Oh, bird of my soul, fly away now, For I possess a hundred fortified towers." ,
"My sweet heart, you have aroused my passion, your touch has filled me with desire, I am no longer separate from you, these are precious moments, I beseech you, don't let me wait," ,
"What can I do my friends, if I do not know? I am neither Christian nor Jew, nor Muslim nor Hindu. What can I do? What can I do? Not of the East, nor of the West, Nor of the land, nor of the sea, Not of nature's essence, nor of circling heavens. What could I be?" ,
"Most people guard against going into the fire and so end up in it. Those who love the water of pleasure and make it their devotion are cheated with this reversal. The trickery goes further. The voice of the fire tells the truth, sayin I am not fire. I am fountainhead. Come into me and don't mind the sparks. If you are a friend of the presence, fire is your water." , 
"And you? When will you begin that long journey into yourself?" ,
"Be suspicious of what you want." ,
"Knowledge that is acquired is not like this. Those who have it worry if audiences like it or not. It's a bait for popularity. Disputational knowing wants customers. It has no soul... The only real customer is God. Chew quietly your sweet sugarcane God-Love, and stay playfully childish." ,
"Love is a madman, working his wild schemes, tearing off his clothes, running through the mountains, drinking poison, and now quietly choosing annihilation." ,
"These Exhaling Sounds Is the sweetness of the cane sweeter than the one who made the canefield? Behind the beauty of the moon is the moonmaker. There is intelligence inside the ocean's intelligence feeding our love like an invisible waterwheel. There is a skill to making cooking oil from animal fat. Consider now the knack that makes eyesight from the shining jelly of your eyes. Dawn comes up like a beautiful meal being served. We are hungry and distracted, so in love with the cook. Don't just be proud of your mustache as you drive three donkeys down the road. Instead of gemstones, love the jeweler. Enough of these exhaling sounds. Let the darling finish this who turns listening into seeing." ,

"Beyond Islam and unbelief there is a desert plain. For us, there is a passion in the midst of that expanse. The knower who reaches there will prostrate, there is neither Islam nor unbelief, nor any 'where' in that place." ,
"Be empty of worrying. Think of who created thought!" ,
"AFTER BEING IN LOVE, THE NEXT RESPONSIBILITY Turn me like a waterwheel turning a millstone. Plenty of water, a Living River. Keep me in one place and scatter the love. Leaf-moves in wind, straw drawn toward amber, all parts of the world are in love, but they do not tell their secrets. Cows grazing on a sacramental table, ants whispering in Solomon's ear. Mountains mumbling an echo. Sky, calm. If the sun were not in love, he would have no brightness, the side of the hill no grass on it. The ocean would come to rest somewhere. Be a lover as they are, that you come to know you Beloved. Be faithful that you may know Faith. The other parts of the universe did not accept the next responsibility of love as you can. They were afraid they might make a mistake with it, the inspired knowing that springs from being in love" ,
"When it's cold and raining, you are more beautiful. And the snow brings me even closer to your lips. The inner secret, that which was never born, you are that freshness, and I am with you now. I can't explain the goings, or the comings. You enter suddenly, and I am nowhere again. Inside the majesty." ,

"I see my beauty in you. I become a mirror that cannot close it's eyes to your longing" ,
"Cry Out in Your Weakness A dragon was pulling a bear into its terrible mouth. A courageous man went and rescued the bear. There are such helpers in the world, who rush to save anyone who cries out. Like Mercy itself, they run toward the screaming. And they can't be bought off. If you were to ask one of those, \"Why did you come so quickly?\" He or she would say, \"Because I heard your helplessness.\" Where lowland is, that's where water goes. All medicine wants is pain to cure. And don't just ask for one mercy. Let them flood in. Let the sky open under your feet. Take the cotton out of your ears, the cotton of consolations, so you can hear the sphere-music. . . . Give your weakness to One Who Helps. Crying out loud and weeping are great resources. A nursing mother, all she does is wait to hear her child. Just a little beginning-whimper, and she's there. God created the child, that is, your wanting, so that it might cry out, so that milk might come. Cry out! Don't be stolid and silent with your pain. Lament! And let the milk of Loving flow into you. The hard rain and wind are ways the cloud has to take care of us. Be patient. Respond to every call that excites your spirit. Ignore those that make you fearful and sad, that degrade you back toward disease and death." ,
"Your acts of kindness are iridescent wings of divine love, which linger and continue to uplift others long after your sharing." ,
"You were born with potential. You were born with goodness and trust. You were born with ideals and dreams. You were born with greatness. You were born with wings. You are not meant for crawling, so don't. You have wings. Learn to use them and fly." ,
"The deeper the grief, the more radiant the love." ,
"You whispered softly in the ear of my joyous heart. You know what's on my mind, you've heard my thoughts. I closed my mouth and spoke to you in a hundred silent ways." ,
"HOW SHOULD THE SOUL How should the soul not take wings when from the Glory of God It hears a sweet, kindly call: \"Why are you here, soul? Arise!\" How should a fish not leap fast into the sea form dry land When from the ocean so cool the sound of the waves reaches its How should the falcon not fly back to his king from the hunt When from the falconer's drum it hears to call: \"Oh, come back\"? Why should not every Sufi begin to dance atom-like Around the Sun of duration that saves from impermanence? What graciousness and what beauty? What life-bestowing! What grace! If anyone does without that, woe- what err, what suffering! Oh fly , of fly, O my soul-bird, fly to your primordial home! You have escaped from the cage now- your wings are spread in the air. Oh travel from brackish water now to the fountain of life! Return from the place of the sandals now to the high seat of souls! Go on! Go on! we are going, and we are coming, O soul, From this world of separation to union, a world beyond worlds! How long shall we here in the dust-world like children fill our skirts With earth and with stones without value, with broken shards without worth? Let's take our hand from the dust grove, let's fly to the heavens' high, Let's fly from our childish behaviour and join the banquet of men! Call out, O soul, to proclaim now that you are rules and king! You have the grace of the answer, you know the question as well!" , 
"Should everything pass away, it couldn't happen without You. This heart of mines bears Your imprint; it has nowhere else to turn. The eye of the intellect is drunk with You, the wheeling galaxy is humble before You, the ear of ecstasy is in Your hand; nothing happens without You. The soul is bubbling with You, the heart imbibes from You, the intellect bellows in rapture; nothing happens without You. You, my grape wine and my intoxication, my rose garden and my springtime, my sleep and repose; nothing happens without You. You are my grandeur and glory, you are my possessions and prosperity, you are my purest water; nothing happens without You" ,
